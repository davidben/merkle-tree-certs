# Demo Certificate Generator

This tool generates a corpus of test certificates and issuance log based on a
JSON configuration file. It has been minimally tested and may not yet correctly
match the spec.

Currently this implements the draft-davidben-tls-merkle-tree-certs-09 variant.
It has not yet been updated for -10.
