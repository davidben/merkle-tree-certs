--- abstract

This document describes Merkle Tree certificates, a new form of X.509 certificates which integrate public logging of the certificate, in the style of Certificate Transparency. The integrated design reduces logging overhead in the face of both shorter-lived certificates and large post-quantum signature algorithms, while still achieving comparable security properties to existing X.509 constructions and Certificate Transparency. Merkle Tree certificates additionally admit an optional size optimization that avoids signatures altogether, at the cost of only applying to up-to-date relying parties and older certificates.

# Introduction

In Public Key Infrastructures (PKIs) that use Certificate Transparency (CT) {{?RFC6962}} for a public logging requirement, an authenticating party must present Signed Certificate Timestamps (SCTs) alongside certificates. CT policies often require two or more SCTs per certificate {{APPLE-CT}} {{CHROME-CT}}, each of which carries a signature. These signatures are in addition to those in the certificate chain itself.

Current signature schemes can use as few as 32 bytes per key and 64 bytes per signature {{?RFC8032}}, but post-quantum replacements are much larger. For example, ML-DSA-44 {{?FIPS204=DOI.10.6028/NIST.FIPS.204}} uses 1,312 bytes per public key and 2,420 bytes per signature. ML-DSA-65 uses 1,952 bytes per public key and 3,309 bytes per signature. Even with a directly-trusted intermediate ({{Section 7.5 of ?I-D.ietf-tls-trust-anchor-ids}}), two SCTs and a leaf certificate signature add 7,260 bytes of authentication overhead with ML-DSA-44 and 9,927 bytes with ML-DSA-65.

This increased overhead additionally impacts CT logs themselves. Most of a log's costs scale with the total storage size of the log. Each log entry contains both a public key, and a signature from the CA. With larger public keys and signatures, the size of each log entry will grow.

Additionally, as PKIs transition to shorter-lived certificates {{CABF-153}} {{CABF-SC081}}, the rate at which entries are added to the log will increase.

This document introduces Merkle Tree Certificates (MTCs), a new form of X.509 certificate that integrates logging with certificate issuance. Each CA maintains logs of everything it issues, signing views of its logs to assert it has issued the contents. The CA signature is combined with cosignatures from other parties who verify correct operation and optionally mirror the logs. These signatures, together with an inclusion proof for an individual entry, constitute a certificate.

This achieves the following:

* Log entries do not scale with public key and signature sizes. Entries replace public keys with hashes and do not contain signatures, while preserving non-repudiability ({{non-repudiation}}).

* Long-expired entries can be revoked from relying parties in bulk (see {{revoked-ranges}}). This allows logging and monitoring infrastructure to scale by retention policies, not the lifetime of the log, even as certificate lifetimes decrease.

* After a processing delay, authenticating parties can obtain a second "landmark-relative" certificate for the same log entry. This second certificate is an optional size optimization that avoids the need for any signatures, assuming an up-to-date client that has some predistributed log information.

{{overview}} gives an overview of the system. {{subtrees}} describes a Merkle Tree primitive used by this system. {{issuance-logs}} describes the log structure. Finally, {{certificates}} and {{relying-parties}} describe how to construct and consume a Merkle Tree certificate.

# Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

This document additionally uses the TLS presentation language defined in {{Section 3 of !RFC9846}}, as well as the notation defined in {{Section 2.1.1 of !RFC9162}}. It extends the numeric types defined in {{Section 3.3 of !RFC9846}} with a big-endian, 48-bit integer:

~~~tls-presentation
uint8 uint48[6];
~~~

`U+` followed by four hexadecimal characters denotes a Unicode codepoint, to be encoded in UTF-8 {{!RFC3629}}. `0x` followed by two hexadecimal characters denotes a byte value in the 0-255 range.

The *decimal representation* of a non-negative integer is its base-ten representation, written with the ASCII digits `0` through `9` (U+0030 through U+0039). Zero is written as the single digit `0`, and no other value is written with a leading `0`.

`[start, end)`, where `start <= end`, denotes the half-open interval containing integers `x` such that `start <= x < end`.

Given a non-negative integer `n`,

* `LSB(n)` refers to the least-significant bit of `n`'s binary representation. Equivalently, it is the remainder when `n` is divided by 2.

* `BIT_WIDTH(n)` refers to the smallest number of bits needed to represent `n`. `BIT_WIDTH(0)` is zero.

* `POPCOUNT(n)` refers to the number of set bits in `n`'s binary representation.

* `BIT_CEIL(n)` refers to the smallest power of 2 that is greater or equal to `n`.

To *left-shift* a non-negative integer `n` is to shift each bit in its binary representation to one upper position. Equivalently, it is `n` times 2. Given non-negative integers `a` and `b`, `a << b` refers to `a` left-shifted `b` times.

To *right-shift* a non-negative integer `n` is to shift each bit in its binary representation to one lower position, discarding the least-significant bit. Equivalently, it is the floor of `n` divided by 2. Given non-negative integers `a` and `b`, `a >> b` refers to `a` right-shifted `b` times.

Given two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, `a & b` refers to the non-negative integer such that each bit position is set if the corresponding bit is set in both `a` and `b`, and unset otherwise. This is commonly referred to as the bitwise AND operator.

## Terminology and Roles

This document discusses the following roles:

Authenticating party:
: The party that authenticates itself in the protocol. In TLS, this is the side sending the Certificate and CertificateVerify message.

Certification authority (CA):
: The service that issues certificates to the authenticating party, after performing some validation process on the certificate contents.

Relying party:
: The party to whom the authenticating party presents its identity. In TLS, this is the side receiving the Certificate and CertificateVerify message.

Monitor:
: Parties who watch logs for certificates of interest, analogous to the role in {{Section 8.2 of ?RFC9162}}.

Issuance log:
: A log, maintained by the CA, containing certification statements issued by that CA. A CA operates some number of issuance logs, which together contain all statements issued by that CA.

Cosigner:
: A service that signs views of an issuance log, to assert correct operation and other properties about the entries.

Additionally, there are several terms used throughout this document to describe this proposal. This section provides an overview. They will be further defined and discussed in detail throughout the document.

Checkpoint:
: A description of the complete state of the log at some time.

Entry:
: An individual element of the log, describing information which the CA has validated and certified.

Subtree:
: A smaller Merkle Tree over a portion of the log, defined by an interior node of some snapshot of the log. Subtrees can be efficiently shown to be consistent with the whole log.

Inclusion proof:
: A sequence of hashes that efficiently proves some entry is contained in some checkpoint or subtree.

Consistency proof:
: A sequence of hashes that efficiently proves a checkpoint or subtree is contained within another checkpoint.

Cosignature:
: A signature from either the CA or other cosigner, over some checkpoint or subtree.

Landmark:
: One of a sequence of tree sizes, infrequently chosen and used to calculate landmark subtrees for predistribution to relying parties.

Landmark subtree:
: One of the two (possibly empty) subtrees determined by an interval between two landmarks. Predistributed and used as the basis for landmark-relative certificates.

Standalone certificate:
: A certificate containing an inclusion proof to some subtree, and several cosignatures over that subtree.

Landmark-relative certificate:
: An optimized certificate containing an inclusion proof to a landmark subtree, and no signatures.

Directly-signed certificate:
: A certificate issued using the existing, non-MTC construction, where the TBSCertificate is passed directly to the private key's signing operation.

# Overview

In Certificate Transparency, a CA first certifies information by signing it, then submits the resulting certificate (or precertificate) to logs for logging. Merkle Tree Certificates invert this process: the CA certifies information by logging it, then submits the log to cosigners to verify log operation. A certificate is assembled from the result and proves the information is in the CA's log.

{: #fig-issuance-overview title="A diagram of the MTC issuance architecture, detailed below"}

Merkle Tree Certificates are issued as follows. {{fig-issuance-overview}} depicts this process.

1. The authenticating party requests a certificate, e.g. over ACME {{?RFC8555}}

2. The CA validates each incoming issuance request, e.g. with ACME challenges. From there, the process diverges from CT-based PKIs.

3. The CA operates a series of append-only *issuance logs* ({{issuance-logs}}). Unlike a CT log, these logs only contain entries added by the CA:

   {: type="a"}
   1. The CA adds a TBSCertificateLogEntry ({{log-entries}}, abbreviated "tbscert entries" in the diagram) to an issuance log, describing the information it is certifying.

   2. The CA signs a *checkpoint*, which describes the current state of the log. A signed checkpoint certifies that the CA issued *every* entry in the Merkle Tree ({{certification-authority-cosigners}}).

   3. The CA additionally signs *subtrees* ({{subtrees}}) that together contain certificates added since the last checkpoint ({{arbitrary-intervals}}). This is an optimization to reduce inclusion proof sizes. A signed subtree certifies that the CA has issued *every* entry in the subtree.

4. The CA submits the new log state to *cosigners*. Cosigners validate the log is append-only and optionally provide additional services, such as mirroring its contents. They cosign the CA's checkpoints and subtrees.

5. The CA now has enough information to construct a certificate and give it to the authenticating party. A certificate contains:

   * The TBSCertificate being certified
   * An inclusion proof from the TBSCertificate to some subtree
   * Cosignatures from the CA and cosigners on the subtree

6. As in Certificate Transparency, monitors observe the CA's issuance logs to ensure the CA is operated correctly.

A certificate with cosignatures is known as a *standalone certificate*. Analogous to X.509 trust anchors and trusted CT logs, relying parties are configured with trusted cosigners ({{trusted-cosigners}}) that allow them to accept Merkle Tree certificates. The inclusion proof proves the TBSCertificate is part of some subtree, and cosignatures from trusted cosigners prove the subtree was certified by the CA and available to monitors. Where CT logs entire certificates, the issuance log's entries are smaller TBSCertificateLogEntry ({{log-entries}}) structures, which do not scale with public key or signature size.

This same issuance process also produces a *landmark-relative certificate*. This is an optional, optimized certificate that avoids all cosignatures, including the CA signature. Landmark-relative certificates are available after a short period of time and usable with up-to-date relying parties.

{: #fig-landmark-cert-overview title="A diagram of landmark-relative certificate construction and usage, detailed below"}

Landmark-relative certificates are constructed and used as follows. {{fig-landmark-cert-overview}} depicts this process.

1. Periodically, the tree size of the CA's most recent checkpoint is designated as a *landmark*. This determines *landmark subtrees*, which are common points of reference between relying parties and landmark-relative certificates.

2. Once some landmark includes the TBSCertificate, the landmark-relative certificate is constructed with:

   * The TBSCertificate being certified
   * An inclusion proof from the TBSCertificate to a landmark subtree

3. In the background, landmark subtrees are predistributed to relying parties, with cosignatures checked against relying party requirements. This occurs periodically in the background, separate from the application protocol.

4. During the application protocol, such as TLS {{?RFC9846}}, if the relying party already supports the landmark subtree, the authenticating party can present the landmark-relative certificate. Otherwise, it presents a standalone certificate. The authenticating party may also select between several landmark-relative certificates, as described in {{certificate-renewal}}.

# Subtrees

This section extends the Merkle Tree definition in {{Section 2.1 of !RFC9162}} by defining a *subtree* of a Merkle Tree. A subtree is itself a Merkle Tree, built over an interval of entries from the original tree. {{definition-of-a-subtree}} defines a subtree formally, including the constraints on those intervals.

As with Merkle Trees, a subtree inclusion proof, defined in {{subtree-inclusion-proofs}}, can prove an entry is contained in some subtree. Subtrees, and thus their inclusion proofs, are smaller than those of the original tree, so this document uses subtree inclusion proofs as a certificate size optimization.

Not all intervals can form subtrees. Subtrees are limited to intervals that can be efficiently proven consistent with the original tree, using subtree consistency proofs defined in {{subtree-consistency-proofs}}. However, every interval of a Merkle Tree can be efficiently covered by two subtrees. {{arbitrary-intervals}} describes how to determine these subtrees.

{{accumulated-subtree-test-vectors}} and {{large-subtree-test-vectors}} provide test vectors for the algorithms defined in this section.

## Definition of a Subtree

Given an ordered list of `n` inputs, `D_n = {d[0], d[1], ..., d[n-1]}`, {{Section 2.1.1 of !RFC9162}} defines the Merkle Tree via the Merkle Tree Hash `MTH(D_n)`.

A *subtree* of this Merkle Tree is itself a Merkle Tree, defined by `MTH(D[start:end])`. `start` and `end` are integers such that:

*  `0 <= start <= end <= n`
* `start` is a multiple of `BIT_CEIL(end - start)`

The second condition ensures that `MTH(D[start:end])`, built over `D[start:end]` as an independent list, is sufficiently aligned with the original Merkle Tree to support subtree consistency proofs. See {{subtrees-explain}} for more details.

In implementations using fixed-width integers, `BIT_CEIL(end - start)` above may exceed `end` and potentially overflow. For example, if `start` is zero and `end` is 2<sup>63</sup>+1, `BIT_CEIL(end - start)` is 2<sup>64</sup>. The following is an example C++ implementation that handles this condition.

~~~c++
bool is_valid_subtree(uint64_t start, uint64_t end) {
  if (start > end) {
    return false;
  }
  uint64_t size = end - start;
  if (size > (uint64_t{1} << 63)) {
    return start == 0;  // bit_ceil below will overflow.
  }
  return (start & (std::bit_ceil(size) - 1)) == 0;
}
~~~

For all `x`, `[0, x)` is a valid subtree (0 is a multiple of everything), and `[x, x)` is a valid subtree (`BIT_CEIL(0)` is 1).

The *size* of the subtree is `end - start`.

In the context of a single Merkle Tree, this document denotes subtree `MTH(D[start:end])` by half-open interval `[start, end)`. It contains the entries whose indices are in that half-open interval.

As a Merkle Tree grows, its subtrees remain unchanged. That is, if `end <= m <= n`, the subtree `[start, end)` of `MTH(D[0:m])` and the subtree `[start, end)` of `MTH(D_n)` are both valid and identical.

{{subtrees-explain}} discusses subtrees in more detail.

## Subtree Inclusion Proofs

Subtrees are Merkle Trees, so entries can be proven to be contained in the subtree. A subtree inclusion proof for entry `index` of the subtree `[start, end)` is a Merkle inclusion proof, as defined in {{Section 2.1.3.1 of !RFC9162}}, where `m` is `index - start` and the tree inputs are `D[start:end]`.

Subtree inclusion proofs contain a sequence of nodes that are sufficient to reconstruct the subtree hash, `MTH(D[start:end])`, out of the hash for entry `index`, `MTH({d[index]})`, thus demonstrating that the subtree hash contains the entry's hash.

### Example Subtree Inclusion Proofs

The inclusion proof for entry 10 of subtree `[8, 13)` contains the hashes `MTH({d[11]})`, `MTH(D[8:10])`, and `MTH({d[12]})`, depicted in  {{fig-subtree-inclusion-proof}}. `MTH({d[10]})` is not part of the proof because the verifier is assumed to already know its value.

### Evaluating a Subtree Inclusion Proof

Given a subtree inclusion proof, `inclusion_proof`, for entry `index`, with hash `entry_hash`, of a subtree `[start, end)`, the subtree inclusion proof can be *evaluated* to compute the expected subtree hash:

<!-- If changing this procedure, remember to update {{inclusion-proof-evaluation-explain}} -->

1. Check that `[start, end)` is a valid subtree ({{definition-of-a-subtree}}), and that `start <= index < end`. If either does not hold, fail proof evaluation.

1. Set `fn` to `index - start` and `sn` to `end - start - 1`.

1. Set `r` to `entry_hash`.

1. For each value `p` in the `inclusion_proof` array:

   1. If `sn` is 0, then stop the iteration and fail proof evaluation.

   1. If `LSB(fn)` is set, or if `fn` is equal to `sn`, then:

      1. Set `r` to `HASH(0x01 || p || r)`.

      1. Until `LSB(fn)` is set, right-shift `fn` and `sn` equally.

      Otherwise:

      1. Set `r` to `HASH(0x01 || r || p)`.

   1. Finally, right-shift both `fn` and `sn` one time.

1. If `sn` is not zero, fail proof evaluation.

1. Return `r` as the expected subtree hash.

This is the same as the procedure in {{Section 2.1.3.2 of !RFC9162}}, where `leaf_index` is `index - start`, `tree_size` is `end - start`, and `r` is returned instead of compared with `root_hash`.

{{inclusion-proof-evaluation-explain}} explains this procedure in more detail.

### Verifying a Subtree Inclusion Proof

Given a subtree inclusion proof, `inclusion_proof`, for entry `index`, with hash `entry_hash`, of a subtree `[start, end)` with hash `subtree_hash`, the subtree inclusion proof can be *verified* to verify the described entry is contained in the subtree:

1. Let `expected_subtree_hash` be the result of evaluating the inclusion proof as described {{evaluating-a-subtree-inclusion-proof}}. If evaluation fails, fail the proof verification.

1. If `subtree_hash` is equal to `expected_subtree_hash`, the entry is contained in the subtree. Otherwise, fail the proof verification.

## Subtree Consistency Proofs

A subtree `[start, end)` can be efficiently proven to be consistent with the full Merkle Tree. That is, given `MTH(D[start:end])` and `MTH(D_n)`, the proof demonstrates that the input `D[start:end]` to the subtree hash was equal to the corresponding elements of the input `D_n` to the Merkle Tree hash.

Subtree consistency proofs contain sufficient nodes to reconstruct both the subtree hash, `MTH(D[start:end])`, and the original tree hash, `MTH(D_n)`, in such a way that every input to the subtree hash was also incorporated into the original tree hash.

### Generating a Subtree Consistency Proof

The subtree consistency proof, `SUBTREE_PROOF(start, end, D_n)` is defined similarly to {{Section 2.1.4.1 of !RFC9162}}.

If `start = end`, the consistency proof is empty:

~~~pseudocode
SUBTREE_PROOF(start, start, D_n) = {}
~~~

Otherwise, `start < end` and `SUBTREE_PROOF` is defined by a helper function:

~~~pseudocode
SUBTREE_PROOF(start, end, D_n) =
    SUBTREE_SUBPROOF(start, end, D_n, true)
~~~

The boolean parameter tracks whether the first hash in the proof will be omitted by the base case. The first hash is omitted when it's equal to the original subtree hash `MTH(D[start:end])`, since the verifier will already know that hash. That happens when the original subtree's root is a node in the Merkle Tree constructed from `D_n`, or equivalently, when the original subtree is full or has `end = n`.

If `start = 0` and `end = n`, the subtree is the root (base case):

~~~pseudocode
SUBTREE_SUBPROOF(0, n, D_n, true) = {}
SUBTREE_SUBPROOF(0, n, D_n, false) = {MTH(D_n)}
~~~

Otherwise, `n > 1`. Let `k` be the largest power of two smaller than `n`. The consistency proof is defined recursively as:

* If `end <= k`, the subtree is on the left of `k`. The proof proves consistency with the left child and includes the right child:

  ~~~pseudocode
  SUBTREE_SUBPROOF(start, end, D_n, b) =
      SUBTREE_SUBPROOF(start, end, D[0:k], b) : MTH(D[k:n])
  ~~~

* If `k <= start`, the subtree is on the right of `k`. The proof proves consistency with the right child and includes the left child.

  ~~~pseudocode
  SUBTREE_SUBPROOF(start, end, D_n, b) =
      SUBTREE_SUBPROOF(start - k, end - k, D[k:n], b) : MTH(D[0:k])
  ~~~

* Otherwise, `start < k < end`, which implies `start = 0`. The proof proves consistency with the right child and includes the left child.

  ~~~pseudocode
  SUBTREE_SUBPROOF(0, end, D_n, b) =
      SUBTREE_SUBPROOF(0, end - k, D[k:n], false) : MTH(D[0:k])
  ~~~

When `start` is zero, this computes a Merkle consistency proof:

~~~pseudocode
SUBTREE_PROOF(0, end, D_n) = PROOF(end, D_n)
~~~

When `end = start + 1`, this computes a Merkle inclusion proof:

~~~pseudocode
SUBTREE_PROOF(start, start + 1, D_n) = PATH(start, D_n)
~~~

### Verifying a Subtree Consistency Proof

The following procedure can be used to verify a subtree consistency proof.

Given a Merkle Tree over `n` elements, a subtree defined by `[start, end)`, a consistency proof `proof`, a subtree hash `node_hash`, and a root hash `root_hash`:

<!-- If changing this procedure, remember to update {{consistency-proof-verification-explain}} -->

1. Check that `[start, end)` is a valid subtree ({{definition-of-a-subtree}}), and that `end <= n`. If either does not hold, fail proof verification. These checks imply `0 <= start <= end <= n`.
1. If `start` equals `end`, check the following conditions:
   * `proof` is an empty array.
   * `node_hash` is equal to `HASH()`, the hash of the empty string.

   If either condition does not hold, stop and fail the proof verification. If both hold, stop and accept the proof.
1. Set `fn` to `start`, `sn` to `end - 1`, and `tn` to `n - 1`.
1. If `sn` is `tn`, then:
   1. Until `fn` is `sn`, right-shift `fn`, `sn`, and `tn` equally.
1. Otherwise:
   1. Until `fn` is `sn` or `LSB(sn)` is not set, right-shift `fn`, `sn`, and `tn` equally.
1. If `fn` is `sn`, set `fr` and `sr` to `node_hash`.
1. Otherwise:
   1. If `proof` is an empty array, stop and fail verification.
   1. Remove the first value of the `proof` array and set `fr` and `sr` to the removed value.
1. For each value `c` in the `proof` array:
   1. If `tn` is `0`, then stop the iteration and fail the proof verification.
   1. If `LSB(sn)` is set, or if `sn` is equal to `tn`, then:
      1. If `fn < sn`, set `fr` to `HASH(0x01 || c || fr)`.
      1. Set `sr` to `HASH(0x01 || c || sr)`.
      1. Until `LSB(sn)` is set, right-shift `fn`, `sn`, and `tn` equally.
   1. Otherwise:
      1. Set `sr` to `HASH(0x01 || sr || c)`.
   1. Right-shift `fn`, `sn`, and `tn` once more.
1. Compare `tn` to `0`, `fr` to `node_hash`, and `sr` to `root_hash`. If any are not equal, fail the proof verification. If all are equal, accept the proof.

## Efficiently Covering Arbitrary Intervals {#arbitrary-intervals}

This document uses subtrees to sign over arbitrary intervals, `[start, end)`, of a Merkle Tree. However, not all intervals are valid subtrees. While subtrees containing the intervals would suffice, the smallest subtree containing `[start, end)` may be much larger than `[start, end)`.

For example, {{fig-subtree-counterexample}} shows the smallest subtree that contains `[7, 9)` in a 9-element tree. The smallest single subtree that contains the interval is `[0, 9)`, but this is the entire tree.

This section defines a procedure for selecting two subtrees given any interval. Combined, the subtrees contain `[start, end)` with bounded excess elements. The procedure returns two subtrees, `left` and `right`, that satisfy the following properties:

* The two subtrees cover adjacent intervals. That is, `left.end = right.start`.
* The two subtrees together contain the entire interval `[start, end)`. There are no extra entries after `end`, but there may be extra entries before `start`. That is, `left.start <= start` and `end = right.end`.
* If the interval is not empty, the extra entries before `start` are less than half of `left`. That is, `start - left.start < left.end - start`.

The subtrees are selected as follows:

1. If `end - start` is less than or equal to 1, return the subtrees `[start, end)` and `[end, end)`.

2. Otherwise:

   1. Let `last` be `end - 1`, the last index in `[start, end)`.

   2. Let `split` be the bit index of the most significant bit where `start` and `last` differ. Bits are numbered from the least significant bit, starting at zero. `split` is the height at which `start` and `last`'s paths in the tree diverge.

   3. Let `mid` be `last` with the least significant `split` bits set to zero. `mid` is the leftmost leaf node in the above divergence point's right branch.

   4. Within the least significant `split` bits of `start`, let `b` be the bit index of the most significant bit with value zero, if any:

      1. If there is such a bit, let `left_split` be `b + 1`.
      2. Otherwise, let `left_split` be zero.

      `left_split` is the height of the lowest common ancestor of the nodes in `[start, mid)`.

   5. Let `left_start` be `start` with the least significant `left_split` bits set to zero. `left_start` is the above lowest common ancestor's leftmost leaf node.

   6. Return the subtrees `[left_start, mid)` and `[mid, end)`.

Intuitively, this procedure considers the tree `MTH(D[0:end])` and finds the lowest common ancestor of the elements in `[start, end)`. It splits the interval by that ancestor's left and right children and returns the lowest common ancestor of each half.

The following Python code implements this procedure:

~~~python
def find_subtrees(start, end):
    """ Returns a pair of subtrees that efficiently cover
    [start, end). """
    assert start <= end
    if end - start <= 1:
        return (start, end), (end, end)
    last = end - 1
    # Find where start and last's tree paths diverge. The two
    # subtrees will be on either side of the split.
    split = (start ^ last).bit_length() - 1
    mask = (1 << split) - 1
    mid = last & ~mask
    # Maximize the left endpoint. This is just before start's
    # path leaves the right edge of its new subtree.
    left_split = (~start & mask).bit_length()
    left_start = start & ~((1 << left_split) - 1)
    return (left_start, mid), (mid, end)
~~~

{{fig-subtree-pair-example}} shows the subtrees which cover `[5, 13)` in a Merkle Tree of 13 elements in wavy lines. The two subtrees selected are `[4, 8)` and `[8, 13)`. Note that the subtrees cover a slightly larger interval than `[5, 13)`.

# Certification Authorities

A CA consists of the following components:

* A CA ID ({{ca-ids}}), which uniquely identifies the CA.

* A collision-resistant cryptographic hash function, used by the CA's issuance logs. SHA-256 {{!SHS=DOI.10.6028/NIST.FIPS.180-4}} is RECOMMENDED. Throughout this document, this hash function is referred to as HASH, and the size of its output in bytes is referred to as HASH_SIZE.

* A series of issuance logs ({{issuance-logs}}), which contain all statements the CA has certified. One issuance log is designated as the current log.

* A CA cosigner ({{certification-authority-cosigners}}), which signs subtrees of issuance logs to certify their contents.

* Optionally, a landmark sequence per log ({{landmark-tree-sizes}}), to support optimized landmark-relative certificates.

{{representing-certification-authorities}} defines an X.509 certificate representation of a CA.

## Certification Authority Identifiers {#ca-ids}

Each Merkle Tree Certificate CA has a *CA ID* to identify it. This CA ID is a trust anchor ID {{!I-D.ietf-tls-trust-anchor-ids}}.

Once allocated, the ID's entire object identifier (OID) arc is reserved by this protocol. Given a CA ID whose OID representation is `caID`, this document allocates the following OIDs:

* For each positive integer `N`, the OID `{caID logs(0) N}` represents the issuance log `N` ({{issuance-logs}}).

* For each positive integer `N` and `L`, the OID `{caID landmarks(1) N L}` represents landmark `L` ({{landmark-tree-sizes}}) of issuance log `N`. These OIDs may be used as trust anchor IDs, as described in {{landmark-relative-certificates-tls}}. These OIDs are used when it is necessary to identify an individual landmark, e.g. as in the retry mechanism described in {{Section 4.3 of !I-D.ietf-tls-trust-anchor-ids}}.

* For each positive integer `N` and `L`, the OID `{caID landmarkGroups(2) N L}` represents a trust anchor group ({{Section 5 of !I-D.ietf-tls-trust-anchor-ids}}) containing landmark `L` of log `N` and earlier landmarks of that log, as defined in {{single-log-landmark-groups}}. These OIDs may be used to advertise a series of landmarks at once.

Future extensions to this protocol MAY define further allocations.

A CA ID determines a PKIX distinguished name ({{Section 4.1.2.4 of !RFC5280}}) that can be used in the issuer or subject field of an X.509 TBSCertificate. This distinguished name has a single relative distinguished name, which has a single attribute. The attribute has type `id-rdna-trustAnchorID`, defined below:

~~~asn.1
id-rdna-trustAnchorID OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
    iso(1) identified-organization(3) dod(6) internet(1) security(5)
    mechanisms(5) pkix(7) rdna(25) TBD }
~~~

The attribute's value is a RELATIVE-OID containing the trust anchor ID's ASN.1 representation. For example, the distinguished name for a CA with ID `32473.1` would be represented in syntax of {{?RFC4514}} as:

~~~
1.3.6.1.5.5.7.25.TBD=#0d0481fd5901
~~~

For initial experimentation, early implementations of this design will:

1. Use UTF8String to represent the attribute's value rather than RELATIVE-OID. The UTF8String contains the trust anchor ID's ASCII representation, e.g. `32473.1`.

1. Use the OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.44363.47.1 instead of `id-rdna-trustAnchorID`. Cloudflare has kindly donated the 1.3.6.1.4.1.44363.47 OID arc for use in this document.

For example, the distinguished name for a CA with ID `32473.1` would be represented in syntax of {{?RFC4514}} as:

~~~
1.3.6.1.4.1.44363.47.1=#0c0733323437332e31
~~~

## Issuance Logs

A CA operates a series of issuance logs, each identified by a positive integer *log number*. Log numbers are numbered consecutively from 1 to at most 65535 (2<sup>16</sup>-1).

Each issuance log has a *log ID*, which is a trust anchor ID constructed by concatenating the following OID components:

* The CA ID ({{ca-ids}})
* The constant 0
* The log number of the log

A log ID specifies both the CA and the log number in a single ID.

Each issuance log describes an append-only sequence of at most 2<sup>48</sup>-1 *entries* ({{log-entries}}). Each entry is identified by an integer *index*, assigned consecutively starting from zero. Each entry is an assertion that the CA has certified. The entries in the issuance log are represented as a Merkle Tree, described in {{Section 2.1 of !RFC9162}}.

Unlike {{?RFC6962}} and {{?RFC9162}}, an issuance log does not have a public submission interface. The log only contains entries which the log operator, i.e. the CA, chose to add. As entries are added, the Merkle Tree is updated to be computed over the new sequence.

A snapshot of the log is known as a *checkpoint*. A checkpoint is identified by its *tree size*, that is the number of elements committed to the log at the time. Its contents can be described by the Merkle Tree Hash ({{Section 2.1.1 of !RFC9162}}) of entries zero through `tree_size - 1`.

At any point in time, one of the CA's issuance logs is its *current* log. Initially, this is log 1. A CA MUST NOT append to any log that is not the current log. Logs before the current log may have historical entries. Logs after the current log MUST be empty. A CA MAY increment its current log number as part of recovering from certain operational failures. See {{log-failures}} for further discussion.

### Log Entries

Each entry in the log is an MTCLogEntry, defined with the TLS presentation syntax below. An MTCLogEntry describes certificate information that the CA has validated and certified.

~~~tls-presentation
struct {} Empty;

enum { (2^16-1) } MTCLogEntryExtensionType;

struct {
    MTCLogEntryExtensionType extension_type;
    opaque extension_data<0..2^16-1>;
} MTCLogEntryExtension;

enum {
    null_entry(0), tbs_cert_entry(1), (2^16-1)
} MTCLogEntryType;

struct {
    MTCLogEntryExtension extensions<0..2^16-1>;
    MTCLogEntryType type;
    select (type) {
       case null_entry: Empty;
       case tbs_cert_entry: opaque tbs_cert_entry_data[N];
       /* May be extended with future types. */
    }
} MTCLogEntry;
~~~

The `extensions` field is a list of tag-length-value extensions associated with the log entry. Extensions MUST appear in the list in ascending order by `extension_type`, and the list MUST NOT contain two extensions with the same `extension_type`.

When `type` is `null_entry`, the entry does not represent any information. Entries at any index in the log MAY have type `null_entry`.

When `type` is `tbs_cert_entry`, `N` is the number of bytes needed to consume the rest of the input. An MTCLogEntry is expected to be decoded in contexts where the total length of the entry is known.

`tbs_cert_entry_data` contains the contents octets (i.e. excluding the initial identifier and length octets) of the DER {{X.690}} encoding of a TBSCertificateLogEntry, defined below. Equivalently, `tbs_cert_entry_data` contains the DER encodings of each field of the TBSCertificateLogEntry, concatenated. This construction allows a single-pass implementation in {{verifying-certificate-signatures}}.

~~~asn.1
TBSCertificateLogEntry ::= SEQUENCE {
    version               [0] EXPLICIT Version DEFAULT v1,
    issuer                    Name,
    validity                  Validity,
    subject                   Name,
    subjectPublicKeyAlgorithm AlgorithmIdentifier{PUBLIC-KEY,
                                  {PublicKeyAlgorithms}},
    subjectPublicKeyInfoHash  OCTET STRING,
    issuerUniqueID        [1] IMPLICIT UniqueIdentifier OPTIONAL,
    subjectUniqueID       [2] IMPLICIT UniqueIdentifier OPTIONAL,
    extensions            [3] EXPLICIT Extensions{{CertExtensions}}
                                           OPTIONAL
}
~~~

The fields of a TBSCertificateLogEntry are defined as follows:

* `version`, `validity`, `subject`, `issuerUniqueID`, `subjectUniqueID`, and `extensions` have the same semantics as the corresponding TBSCertificate fields, defined in {{Section 4.1.2 of !RFC5280}}.

* `issuer` is the CA ID as a PKIX distinguished name, as described in {{ca-ids}}.

  * The `issuer` field is not human-readable. A TBSCertificateLogEntry MAY carry a human-readable label for the CA, suitable for display in user interfaces, in an issuer alternative name extension ({{Section 4.2.1.7 of !RFC5280}}). If present, the extension MUST be marked non-critical. The `IssuerAltName` SEQUENCE MUST contain a single `GeneralName` of type `directoryName`, whose `Name` MUST use the `rdnSequence` CHOICE. Each `RelativeDistinguishedName` MUST contain a single `AttributeTypeAndValue`. The extension is purely cosmetic, and MUST NOT be used in path validation or any other trust decision. The value MUST NOT be assumed unique across issuance logs and MAY change across entries in the same issuance log.

* `subjectPublicKeyAlgorithm` describes the algorithm of the subject's public key. It is constructed identically to the `algorithm` field of a SubjectPublicKeyInfo ({{Section 4.1.2.7 of !RFC5280}}).

* `subjectPublicKeyInfoHash` contains the hash of the subject's public key, encoded as a SubjectPublicKeyInfo. The hash uses the CA's hash function ({{certification-authorities}}) and is computed over the SubjectPublicKeyInfo's DER {{X.690}} encoding.

Note the subject's public key algorithm is incorporated into both `subjectPublicKeyAlgorithm` and `subjectPublicKeyInfoHash`.

MTCLogEntry is an extensible structure. Future documents MAY define new values for MTCLogEntryType or MTCLogEntryExtensionType, with corresponding semantics. See {{certification-authority-cosigners}} and {{extensibility}} for additional discussion.

An MTCLogEntry's size MUST NOT exceed 65535 (2<sup>16</sup>-1) bytes. TBSCertificateLogEntry does not include signatures and hashes public keys, so post-quantum algorithms do not contribute to this size.

### Publishing Logs

This protocol aims to enable monitors to detect misissued certificates by observing the issuance log. See {{transparency}}.

This document does not prescribe a particular method of observing the issuance log. The access protocols do not affect certificate interoperability, and different applications could have different needs. For example, a PKI that authenticates public services might publicly serve issuance logs, while a PKI that authenticates a single organization's intranet services might keep the log private to the organization. Relying parties SHOULD define log serving requirements, including the allowed protocols and expected availability, as part of their policies on which CAs to support. See also {{log-availability}}.

If a serving protocol supports serving only a portion of the log, relying party policies SHOULD include requirements on which portions to serve.

For example, {{MTC-TLOG}} defines a profile for Merkle Tree Certificates that uses {{TLOG-TILES}}.

## Cosigners

This section defines a log *cosigner*. A cosigner follows some append-only view of the log and signs subtrees ({{subtrees}}) consistent with that view. The signatures generated by a cosigner are known as *cosignatures*. All subtrees signed by a cosigner MUST be consistent with each other. The cosigner may be external to the log, in which case it might ensure consistency by checking consistency proofs. The cosigner may be operated together with the log, in which case it can trust its log state.

A cosignature MAY implicitly make additional statements about a subtree, determined by the cosigner's role. This document defines one concrete cosigner role, a CA cosigner ({{certification-authority-cosigners}}), to authenticate the log and certify entries. Other documents and specific deployments MAY define other cosigner roles, to perform different functions in a PKI. For example, {{TLOG-WITNESS}} defines a cosigner that only checks the log is append-only, and {{TLOG-MIRROR}} defines a cosigner that mirrors a log.

Each cosigner has a public key and a *cosigner ID*, which uniquely identifies the cosigner. The cosigner ID is a trust anchor ID {{!I-D.ietf-tls-trust-anchor-ids}}. By identifying the cosigner, the cosigner ID specifies the public key, signature algorithm, and any additional statements made by the cosigner's signatures. If a single operator performs multiple cosigner roles in an ecosystem, each role MUST use a distinct cosigner ID and SHOULD use a distinct key.

Following the principle of key separation {{KeyReuse}}, cosigner keys SHOULD NOT be used for purposes outside this document. Additional uses MAY be defined but MUST NOT overlap with the signature format defined in {{signature-format}}. See {{signature-domain-separation}} for additional discussion.

A single cosigner, with a single cosigner ID and public key, MAY generate cosignatures for multiple logs. In this case, signed subtrees only need to be consistent with others for the same log.

### Signature Format

A cosigner computes a *subtree signature* for a subtree in a log by signing a CosignedMessage, defined below using the TLS presentation language ({{Section 3 of !RFC9846}}):

~~~tls-presentation
opaque HashValue[HASH_SIZE];

struct {
    uint8 label[12] = "subtree/v1\n\0";
    opaque cosigner_name<1..2^8-1>;
    uint64 timestamp;
    opaque log_origin<1..2^8-1>;
    uint64 start;
    uint64 end;
    HashValue subtree_hash;
} CosignedMessage;
~~~

This signature format is designed to be compatible with the ML-DSA-44 signature construction in {{TLOG-COSIGNATURE}}, but it supports signature algorithms other than ML-DSA-44 and tree hashes other than SHA-256.

`label` is a fixed prefix for domain separation. Its value MUST be the string `subtree/v1`, followed by a newline (U+000A), followed by a zero byte (U+0000).

`cosigner_name` and `log_origin` are computed from the cosigner ID and the issuance log's ID ({{ca-ids}}), respectively. They contain the concatenation of:

* The 16-byte ASCII string `oid/1.3.6.1.4.1.`
* The trust anchor ID's ASCII representation ({{Section 3 of !I-D.ietf-tls-trust-anchor-ids}})

This is equivalent to the concatenation of:

* The four-byte ASCII string `oid/`
* The trust anchor ID as a full OID, in dotted decimal notation

For example, the trust anchor ID 32473.1 would be encoded as the ASCII string `oid/1.3.6.1.4.1.32473.1`.

`start` and `end` MUST define a valid subtree of the log, and `subtree_hash` MUST be the subtree's hash value in the cosigner's view of the log. See {{definition-of-a-subtree}}.

If `timestamp` is non-zero, it MUST be the time that the signature was produced. This time is represented as seconds since the Epoch, as defined in Section 4.19 of Volume 1 of {{!POSIX=DOI.10.1109/IEEESTD.2024.10555529}}. Additionally, if `timestamp` is non-zero, the following MUST be true:

* `start` MUST be zero.
* `end` MUST be the size of the largest consistent tree that the cosigner has observed for the log.

`timestamp` MAY be zero, in which case no additional constraints are placed on `start` or `end` (beyond being a valid subtree), and no statement is made about the signing time or largest observed tree.

### Signature Semantics

Before signing a subtree of some log, the cosigner MUST ensure that `subtree_hash` is consistent with its view of the log. Different cosigner roles will obtain this assurance differently. For example:

* A cosigner MAY maintain a full copy of the log, e.g. if it's the log operator. The cosigner can then compute `subtree_hash` from this copy.

* A cosigner MAY maintain the hash of the largest consistent tree observed by the log. The cosigner can then check `subtree_hash` with a subtree consistency proof ({{subtree-consistency-proofs}}).

* A cosigner MAY maintain any other representation of the log which allows it to verify the consistency of the log.

In all cases, the cosigner MUST ensure that, as it updates its view of the log, the old and new views are consistent.

When a cosigner signs a subtree, it is held separately responsible *both* for the subtree being consistent with its other signatures, *and* for the cosigner-specific additional statements. That is, if a cosigner signs an inconsistent subtree, it is held responsible for its additional statements on all entries in the inconsistent subtree, even if some other signed subtree exists that asserts different entries.

Subtree signatures can be used to sign timestamped log checkpoints by using a non-zero `timestamp`. A signature with a non-zero `timestamp` asserts the complete state of the cosigner's view of the log at a given time. These signatures are not directly used in Merkle Tree Certificates ({{certificate-format}}), but cosigners MAY generate them, subject to the rules above, as part of other functions in a PKI, such as log serving or integrating an issuance log into a transparency ecosystem. For example, {{TLOG-TILES}} and {{TLOG-WITNESS}} use such signatures.

### Signature Algorithms

The cosigner's public key specifies both the key material and the signature algorithm to use with the key material. In order to change key or signature parameters, a cosigner operator MUST deploy a new cosigner, with a new cosigner ID. Signature algorithms MUST fully specify the algorithm parameters, such as hash functions used. Signatures are computed over the CosignedMessage described in {{signature-format}}.

Log clients that accept cosignatures from some cosigner are assumed to be configured with all parameters necessary to verify that cosigner's signatures, including the signature algorithm and version of the signature format.

## Certification Authority Cosigners

A *CA cosigner* is a cosigner ({{cosigners}}) that certifies the contents of a log. Each CA MUST operate a CA cosigner whose cosigner ID is the same as its CA ID ({{ca-ids}}). A CA cosigner MUST NOT sign checkpoints or subtrees for logs not part of this CA instance.

When a CA cosigner signs a subtree, it makes the additional statement that it has certified each entry in the subtree. For example, a domain-validating CA states that it has performed domain validation for each entry, at some time consistent with the entry's validity dates. CAs are held responsible for every entry in every subtree they sign. Proving an entry is included ({{subtree-inclusion-proofs}}) in a CA-signed subtree is sufficient to prove the CA certified it.

What it means to certify an entry depends on the entry type:

* To certify an entry of type `null_entry` is a no-op. A CA MAY freely certify `null_entry` without being held responsible for any validation.
* To certify an entry of type `tbs_cert_entry` is to certify the TBSCertificateLogEntry, as defined in {{log-entries}}.

Entries are extensible. Future documents MAY define `type` and `extension_type` values and the semantics of the data that they contain. A CA MUST NOT sign a subtree if it contains an entry with `type` or `extension_type` that it does not recognize. Doing so would certify that the CA has validated the information in some not-yet-defined format. {{extensibility}} further discusses security implications of such extensions.

If the CA issues certificate revocation lists (CRLs) {{!RFC5280}} or Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) responses {{!RFC6960}}, the CA's cosigner key MAY be used to directly sign TBSCertList or OCSP ResponseData structures, respectively, but only for this CA instance. Such uses remain subject to other X.509 constraints, such as the key usage extension, which are out of scope for this document. See {{signature-domain-separation}} for a discussion of domain separation.

If the CA operator additionally operates a directly-signing X.509 CA, that CA key MUST be distinct from any Merkle Tree CA cosigner keys. In particular, a CA cosigner key MUST NOT be used to directly sign TBSCertificate structures. A CA cosigner key issues certificates by signing subtrees.

## Representing Certification Authorities

This section defines the X.509 Certificate {{!RFC5280}} representation of a Merkle Tree Certificate CA. It identifies the CA cosigner ({{certification-authority-cosigners}}) and associated issuance logs. This information is encoded as follows:

* The `subject` field MUST be the CA ID as a PKIX distinguished name, as described in {{ca-ids}}.

* The `subjectPublicKeyInfo` field MUST be the public key of the CA cosigner {{certification-authority-cosigners}}.

* The `extensions` field MUST contain a critical extension of type id-pe-mtcCertificationAuthority, defined below.

* The subject key identifier extension ({{Section 4.2.1.2 of !RFC5280}}), if present, SHOULD be set to the CA ID {{ca-ids}}. The CA ID is encoded in its binary representation, as defined in {{Section 3 of !I-D.ietf-tls-trust-anchor-ids}}.

Other fields and extensions in {{!RFC5280}} apply unmodified. In particular:

* The key usage extension ({{Section 4.2.1.3 of !RFC5280}}) MUST be present and assert at least the `keyCertSign` bit.

* The basic constraints extension ({{Section 4.2.1.9 of !RFC5280}}) MUST be present and set the `cA` field to TRUE.

The id-pe-mtcCertificationAuthority extension is defined below. This extension indicates that the subject of the certificate is a CA that issues Merkle Tree Certificates. If present, it MUST be marked as critical.

~~~asn.1
id-pe-mtcCertificationAuthority OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
    iso(1) identified-organization(3) dod(6) internet(1) security(5)
    mechanisms(5) pkix(7) pe(1) TBD }

ext-mtcCertificationAuthority EXTENSION ::= {
    SYNTAX MTCCertificationAuthority
    IDENTIFIED BY id-pe-mtcCertificationAuthority
    CRITICALITY TRUE
}

-- This is 2^64-1, the maximum possible serial number in this protocol.
mtcMaxSerial INTEGER ::= 18446744073709551615

MTCCertificationAuthority ::= SEQUENCE {
    logHash   AlgorithmIdentifier{DIGEST-ALGORITHM, {...}},
    sigAlg    AlgorithmIdentifier{SIGNATURE-ALGORITHM, {...}},
    minSerial INTEGER (0..mtcMaxSerial),
    maxSerial INTEGER (0..mtcMaxSerial)
}
~~~

For initial experimentation, early implementations of this design will use the OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.44363.47.2 instead of `id-pe-mtcCertificationAuthority`. Cloudflare has kindly donated the 1.3.6.1.4.1.44363.47 OID arc for use in this document.

The fields of an MTCCertificationAuthority structure are defined as follows:

* `logHash` describes the hash algorithm used by all logs operated by this CA. For example, if the hash is SHA-256, it would be `mda-sha256` as defined in {{Section 8 of !RFC5912}}.

* `sigAlg` is the CA cosigner's signature algorithm ({{signature-algorithms}}).

* `minSerial` and `maxSerial` describe the minimum and maximum allowed serial numbers from this CA, respectively. See {{revoked-ranges}} for discussion on setting these values.

If this extension is present, the key described in `subjectPublicKeyInfo` is a CA cosigner key and subject to the usage restrictions described in {{certification-authority-cosigners}}. In particular, it MUST NOT be used to directly sign TBSCertificate structures.

This extension indicates the subtree signature format defined in {{signature-format}}. If a later version of the protocol defines a new format, this SHOULD be represented in CA certificates with a new extension type.

A CA certificate using this format SHOULD NOT be self-signed by the Merkle Tree Certificate CA. Doing so would require writing the information in the issuance log. Instead, if used to represent a trust anchor, the certificate SHOULD be an unsigned certificate {{!RFC9925}}.

# Certificates

This section defines how to construct Merkle Tree Certificates, which are X.509 Certificates {{!RFC5280}} that assert the information in an issuance log entry.

## Certificate Inputs

A Merkle Tree Certificate is constructed from the following inputs:

* A TBSCertificateLogEntry ({{log-entries}}) contained in the issuance log ({{issuance-logs}})
* A subject public key whose hash matches the TBSCertificateLogEntry
* The `log_number` and the zero-based entry `index` of that log entry within the issuance log, used to construct the certificate's `serialNumber` ({{certificate-format}}).
* An `MTCProof` ({{certificate-format}}) proving the entry's inclusion in a subtree, along with zero or more signatures ({{cosigners}}) over that subtree, which together satisfy relying party requirements ({{trusted-cosigners}})

By varying the choice of subtree and signatures, there can be multiple ways to prove the entry is in the log, and thus certified by the CA. {{certificate-format}} defines how a certificate is constructed based on those choices. {{standalone-certificates}} and {{landmark-relative-certificates}} define two profiles of Merkle Tree Certificates, standalone certificates and landmark-relative certificates, and how to select the subtree and signatures for them.

## Certificate Format

The information is encoded in an X.509 Certificate {{!RFC5280}} as follows:

The TBSCertificate's `version`, `issuer`, `validity`, `subject`, `issuerUniqueID`, `subjectUniqueID`, and `extensions` MUST be equal to the corresponding fields of the TBSCertificateLogEntry. If any of `issuerUniqueID`, `subjectUniqueID`, or `extensions` is absent in the TBSCertificateLogEntry, the corresponding field MUST be absent in the TBSCertificate. Per {{log-entries}}, this means `issuer` MUST be the issuance log's CA ID as a PKIX distinguished name, as described in {{ca-ids}}.

The TBSCertificate's `serialNumber` is constructed from the zero-based index of the TBSCertificateLogEntry in the log and the log's number ({{issuance-logs}}). The `serialNumber` MUST be equal to `(log_number << 48) | index`. All serial numbers constructed in this way will be positive and at most 2<sup>64</sup>-1.

The TBSCertificate's `subjectPublicKeyInfo` contains the specified public key. Its `algorithm` field MUST match the TBSCertificateLogEntry's `subjectPublicKeyAlgorithm`. Its hash MUST match the TBSCertificateLogEntry's `subjectPublicKeyInfoHash`.

The TBSCertificate's `signature` and the Certificate's `signatureAlgorithm` MUST contain an AlgorithmIdentifier whose `algorithm` is id-alg-mtcProof, defined below, and whose `parameters` is omitted.

~~~asn.1
id-alg-mtcProof OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
    iso(1) identified-organization(3) dod(6) internet(1) security(5)
    mechanisms(5) pkix(7) algorithms(6) TBD }
~~~

For initial experimentation, early implementations of this design will use the OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.44363.47.0 instead of `id-alg-mtcProof`. Cloudflare has kindly donated the 1.3.6.1.4.1.44363.47 OID arc for use in this document.

The `signatureValue` contains an MTCProof structure, defined below using the TLS presentation language ({{Section 3 of !RFC9846}}):

~~~tls-presentation
/* From Section 4.1 of draft-ietf-tls-trust-anchor-ids */
opaque TrustAnchorID<1..2^8-1>;

opaque HashValue[HASH_SIZE];

struct {
    TrustAnchorID cosigner_id;
    opaque signature<0..2^16-1>;
} SubtreeSignature;

struct {
    MTCLogEntryExtension extensions<0..2^16-1>;
    uint48 start;
    uint48 end;
    HashValue inclusion_proof<0..2^16-1>;
    SubtreeSignature signatures<0..2^16-1>;
} MTCProof;
~~~

`extensions` MUST contain the log entry's `extensions` value ({{log-entries}}).

`start` and `end` MUST contain the corresponding parameters of the chosen subtree. `inclusion_proof` MUST contain a subtree inclusion proof ({{subtree-inclusion-proofs}}) for the log entry and the subtree. `signatures` contains the chosen subtree signatures. In each signature, `cosigner_id` contains the cosigner ID ({{cosigners}}) in its binary representation ({{Section 3 of !I-D.ietf-tls-trust-anchor-ids}}), and `signature` contains the signature value as described in {{signature-format}}. The `timestamp` field used when computing the signature MUST be zero.

Each element of the `signatures` field MUST have a unique `cosigner_id`. Elements MUST be ordered by `cosigner_id` (excluding length prefix) as follows:

* Shorter byte strings are ordered before longer byte strings
* Byte strings of the same length are ordered lexicographically

An MTCProof parser MUST reject the input if there are duplicate `cosigner_id` values, or if they are not ordered correctly. This can be done by checking each `cosigner_id` value comes strictly after the previous one in the above order.

The MTCProof is encoded into the `signatureValue` with no additional ASN.1 wrapping. The most significant bit of the first octet of the signature value SHALL become the first bit of the bit string, and so on through the least significant bit of the last octet of the signature value, which SHALL become the last bit of the bit string.

## Standalone Certificates

A *standalone certificate* is a Merkle Tree certificate which contains sufficient signatures to allow a relying party to trust the choice of subtree, without any predistributed information beyond the cosigner(s) parameters. Standalone certificates can be issued without significant processing delay.

When issuing a certificate, the CA first adds the TBSCertificateLogEntry to its issuance log. It then schedules a job to construct a checkpoint and collect cosignatures. The job proceeds as follows:

1. The CA signs the checkpoint with its key(s) ({{certification-authority-cosigners}}).
2. Using the procedure in {{arbitrary-intervals}}, the CA determines the two subtrees that cover the entries added between this checkpoint and the most recent checkpoint.
3. The CA signs each subtree with its key(s) ({{cosigners}}).
4. The CA requests sufficient subtree cosignatures from external cosigners to meet relying party requirements ({{trusted-cosigners}}). Depending on the protocol for requesting subtree cosignatures (e.g. {{TLOG-WITNESS}} and {{TLOG-MIRROR}}), this step may require first requesting a checkpoint cosignature ({{cosigners}}) from each cosigner.
5. For each log entry in the interval, the CA constructs a certificate ({{certificate-format}}) from the inputs in {{certificate-inputs}}, using the covering subtree and the subtree cosignatures collected in steps 3 and 4.

Step 4 is analogous to requesting SCTs from CT logs in Certificate Transparency, except that a single run of this job collects signatures for many certificates at once. The CA MAY request signatures from a redundant set of cosigners and select the ones that complete first.

This document does not place any requirements on how frequently this job runs. More frequent runs result in lower issuance delay, but higher signing overhead. It is RECOMMENDED that CAs run at most one instance of this job at a time, starting the next instance after the previous one completes. A single run collects signatures for all entries since the most recent checkpoint, so there is little benefit to overlapping them. Less frequent runs may also aid relying parties that wish to directly audit signatures, as described in Section 5.2 of {{AuditingRevisited}}, though this document does not define such a system.

This document does not prescribe the specific cosigner roles, or a particular protocol for requesting cosignatures. Protocols for cosigners can vary depending on the needs of that cosigner. Some example protocols are described in {{TLOG-WITNESS}} and {{TLOG-MIRROR}}. It is RECOMMENDED that the CA collect cosignatures for the authenticating party, but the authenticating party MAY collect additional cosignatures and add them to the certificate.

## Landmark-Relative Certificates

A *landmark-relative certificate* is a Merkle Tree certificate which contains no signatures and instead assumes the relying party had predistributed information about which subtrees were trusted. Landmark-relative certificates are an optional size optimization. They require a processing delay to construct, and only work in a sufficiently up-to-date relying party. Authenticating parties thus SHOULD deploy a corresponding standalone certificate alongside any landmark-relative certificate, and use some application-protocol-specific mechanism to select between the two. {{use-in-tls}} discusses such a mechanism for TLS {{!RFC9846}}.

### Landmark Tree Sizes

A CA that issues landmark-relative certificates MUST additionally maintain a *landmark sequence*. A landmark sequence is a sequence of *landmarks*, defined below:

Each landmark consists of a number, used as an identifier for the landmark, and a tree size, used as a common point of reference across the ecosystem for optimizing certificates. Landmarks are numbered consecutively from zero. Landmark zero MUST have a tree size of zero. The sequence of tree sizes MUST be append-only and strictly monotonically increasing.

The landmark sequence determines *landmark subtrees* for each landmark: for each landmark `L`, other than number zero, let `tree_size` be `L`'s tree size and `prev_tree_size` be that of `L - 1`. The landmark subtrees for `L` are the two subtrees that cover `[prev_tree_size, tree_size)`, as described in {{arbitrary-intervals}}. Landmark zero has no landmark subtrees.

As the issuance log grows, CAs continuously allocate new landmarks. This allocation balances minimizing landmark-relative certificate delay with minimizing the size of the relying party's predistributed state. To bound the latter, each CA sets a positive integer `max_active_landmarks` parameter, which is the maximum number of landmarks that may contain unexpired certificates at any time.

The most recent `max_active_landmarks` landmarks are said to be *active*. Landmarks MUST be allocated such that, at any given time, only active landmarks contain unexpired certificates. The active landmark subtrees are those determined by the active landmarks. There are at most `2 * max_active_landmarks` active landmark subtrees at any time. Every unexpired entry will be contained in at least one landmark subtree, or between the last landmark subtree and the latest checkpoint. Active landmark subtrees are predistributed to the relying party as trusted subtrees, as described in {{trusted-subtrees}}.

It is RECOMMENDED that landmarks be allocated following the procedure described in {{allocating-landmarks}}. If landmarks are allocated incorrectly (e.g. past landmarks change, or `max_active_landmarks` is inaccurate), there are no security consequences, but some older certificates may fail to validate.

Relying parties will locally retain up to `2 * max_active_landmarks` hashes ({{trusted-subtrees}}) per CA, so `max_active_landmarks` should be set to balance the delay between landmarks and the amount of state the relying party must maintain. Using the recommended procedure below, a CA with a maximum certificate lifetime of 7 days, allocating a landmark every hour, will have a `max_active_landmarks` of 169. The client state is then 338 hashes, or 10,816 bytes with SHA-256.

### Allocating Landmarks

It is RECOMMENDED that landmarks be allocated using the following procedure:

1. Select some `time_between_landmarks` duration. Define a series of consecutive, non-overlapping time intervals, each of duration `time_between_landmarks`.
2. At most once per time interval, append the latest checkpoint tree size to the landmark sequence if it is greater than the last landmark's tree size.

To ensure that only active landmarks contain unexpired certificates, set `max_active_landmarks` to `ceil(max_cert_lifetime / time_between_landmarks) + 1`, where `max_cert_lifetime` is the CA's maximum certificate lifetime. The `+ 1` accounts for landmarks not allocated at the exact start of their time interval, which can push certificate expiry one interval further than `ceil(max_cert_lifetime / time_between_landmarks)` alone would bound.

### Publishing Landmarks

CAs SHOULD publish their active landmarks, so that relying parties can configure trusted subtrees ({{trusted-subtrees}}). The following format can be used to describe this information. The format is the following sequence of lines. Each line MUST be terminated by a newline character (U+000A):

* The decimal representations of two non-negative integers, separated by a single space character (U+0020): `<last_landmark> <num_active_landmarks>`.
  This line MUST satisfy the following, otherwise it is invalid:
  * `num_active_landmarks <= max_active_landmarks`
  * `num_active_landmarks <= last_landmark`
* `num_active_landmarks + 1` lines, each containing the decimal representation of a tree size. Numbered from zero to `num_active_landmarks`, line `i` contains the tree size for landmark `last_landmark - i`. The tree sizes MUST be strictly monotonically decreasing and less than or equal to the log's latest tree size.

Landmark numbers and tree sizes are both at most 2<sup>48</sup>-1 ({{issuance-logs}}). Any deviation from this format, including additional whitespace or any content following the final line, makes the document invalid. Relying parties MUST reject an invalid document in its entirety, rather than acting on the portion that precedes the error.

It is RECOMMENDED that this format be published as an HTTP resource {{!RFC9110}} with content type `text/plain; charset=utf-8`.

### Constructing Landmark-Relative Certificates

Given the inputs in {{certificate-inputs}} and a landmark sequence, a landmark-relative certificate is constructed as follows:

1. Let `L` be the smallest landmark number in the active window whose tree size is strictly greater than the entry index `i`. Because the landmark sequence is strictly monotonically increasing, `L - 1`'s tree size is less than or equal to `i`. If no such `L` has been allocated yet (`i` is greater than or equal to `last_landmark`'s tree size), wait for one to be allocated. If every landmark that once covered the entry is no longer in the active window (`last_landmark - num_active_landmarks`'s tree size is greater than `i`), abort this process.
2. Determine landmark `L`'s subtrees ({{landmark-tree-sizes}}) and select the unique one whose `[start, end)` interval contains `i`.
3. Construct a certificate ({{certificate-format}}) using the selected subtree and no signatures.

Before sending this certificate, the authenticating party SHOULD obtain an application-protocol-specific signal that implies the relying party has been configured with the corresponding landmark. ({{trusted-subtrees}} defines how relying parties are configured.) The trust anchor ID of the landmark may be used as an efficient identifier in the application protocol. {{use-in-tls}} discusses how to do this in TLS {{!RFC9846}}.

The procedure above is not specific to the CA. In particular, a party holding a standalone certificate ({{standalone-certificates}}) can construct the corresponding landmark-relative certificate by recovering the certificate inputs from it and obtaining the landmark sequence and inclusion proof hashes from the issuance log.

## Size Estimates

The inclusion proofs in standalone and landmark-relative certificates scale logarithmically with the size of the subtree. These sizes can be estimated with the CA's issuance rate. The byte counts below assume the issuance log's hash function is SHA-256.

Some organizations have published statistics which can be used to estimate this rate for the Web PKI. As of June 9th, 2025:

* {{LetsEncrypt}} reported around 558,000,000 active certificates for a single CA
* {{MerkleTown}} reported around 2,100,000,000 unexpired certificates in CT logs, across all CAs
* {{MerkleTown}} reported an issuance rate of around 444,000 certificates per hour, across all CAs

The current issuance rate across the Web PKI may not necessarily be representative of the Web PKI after a transition to short-lived certificates. Assuming a certificate lifetime of 7 days, and that subscribers will update their certificates 75% of the way through their lifetime (see {{certificate-renewal}}), every certificate will be reissued every 126 hours. This gives issuance rate estimates of around 4,400,000 certificates per hour and 17,000,000 certificates per hour, for the first two values above. Note the larger estimate is across all CAs, while subtrees would only span one CA.

Using the per-CA short lifetime estimate, if the CA mints a checkpoint every 2 seconds, standalone certificate subtrees will span around 2,500 certificates, leading to 12 hashes in the inclusion proof, or 384 bytes. Standalone certificates additionally must carry a sufficient set of signatures to meet relying party requirements.

If a new landmark is allocated every hour, landmark-relative certificate subtrees will span around 4,400,000 certificates, leading to 23 hashes in the inclusion proof, giving an inclusion proof size of 736 bytes, with no signatures. This is significantly smaller than a single ML-DSA-44 signature, 2,420 bytes, and almost ten times smaller than the three ML-DSA-44 signatures necessary to include post-quantum SCTs.

Proof sizes grow logarithmically, so 32 hashes, or 1024 bytes, is sufficient for subtrees of up to 2<sup>32</sup> (4,294,967,296) certificates.

# Relying Parties

This section discusses how relying parties verify Merkle Tree Certificates.

## Relying Party Configuration

In order to accept certificates from a Merkle Tree CA, a relying party MUST be configured with:

* The CA's ID ({{ca-ids}})
* The CA's log hash algorithm, e.g. SHA-256
* The CA cosigner, and any other supported cosigners, as pairs of cosigner ID and public key
* A policy on which combinations of cosigners to accept in a certificate ({{trusted-cosigners}})
* An optional list of trusted subtrees that are known to be consistent with the relying party's cosigner requirements ({{trusted-subtrees}})
* A list of revoked ranges of serial numbers ({{revoked-ranges}})

This information may be obtained from a CA certificate structure, defined in {{representing-certification-authorities}}:

* The CA ID is determined from the certificate's subject.

* The log hash algorithm is determined from the id-pe-mtcCertificationAuthority extension.

* The CA cosigner is determined from the certificate's subject public key and id-pe-mtcCertificationAuthority extension. The CA's cosigner ID is the same as its CA ID. The relying party incorporates this cosigner into its cosigner policy based on the guidance in {{trusted-cosigners}}.

* No trusted subtrees are directly represented by the CA certificate structure, but the relying party MAY incorporate trusted subtrees from out-of-band information.

* The revoked serial number ranges include the half-open ranges `[0, minSerial)` and `[maxSerial+1, 2^64)`, but the relying party MAY incorporate additional ranges from out-of-band information.

## Verifying Certificate Signatures

When verifying the signature of an X.509 certificate (Step (a)(1) of {{Section 6.1.3 of !RFC5280}}) whose issuer is a Merkle Tree CA, the relying party performs the following procedure:

1. Check that the TBSCertificate's `signature` field is `id-alg-mtcProof` with omitted parameters. If this check fails, abort this process and fail verification.

1. Decode the `signatureValue` as an MTCProof, as described in {{certificate-format}}. If decoding fails, including if `signatureValue` is not a multiple of 8 bits or has extra data after the MTCProof, abort this process and fail verification.

1. Let `serial` be the certificate's serial number. If `serial` is negative or greater than 2<sup>64</sup>-1, abort this process and fail verification.

1. If `serial` is contained in one of the relying party's revoked ranges ({{revoked-ranges}}), abort this process and fail verification.

1. Let `index` be the least significant 48 bits of `serial` and let `log_number` be `serial >> 48`. If `log_number` is zero, abort this process and fail verification.

1. Let `log_id` be the log ID constructed from the CA ID in `issuer` and the `log_number` ({{issuance-logs}}).

1. Construct a TBSCertificateLogEntry as follows:
   1. Copy the `version`, `issuer`, `validity`, `subject`, `issuerUniqueID`, `subjectUniqueID`, and `extensions` fields from the TBSCertificate.
   1. Set `subjectPublicKeyAlgorithm` to the `algorithm` field of the `subjectPublicKeyInfo`.
   1. Set `subjectPublicKeyInfoHash` to the hash of the DER encoding of `subjectPublicKeyInfo`.

1. Construct an MTCLogEntry as follows:
   1. Set `type` to `tbs_cert_entry`.
   1. Set `extensions` to the MTCProof's `extensions` value.
   1. Set `tbs_cert_entry_data` to the TBSCertificateLogEntry, encoded as described in {{log-entries}}.

1. Let `entry_hash` be the hash of the entry, `MTH({entry}) = HASH(0x00 || entry)`, as defined in {{Section 2.1.1 of !RFC9162}}.

1. Let `expected_subtree_hash` be the result of evaluating the MTCProof's `inclusion_proof` for entry `index`, with hash `entry_hash`, of the subtree described by the MTCProof's `start` and `end`, following the procedure in {{evaluating-a-subtree-inclusion-proof}}. If evaluation fails, abort this process and fail verification.

1. If `log_number`, `start`, and `end` match a trusted subtree ({{trusted-subtrees}}) for the CA, check that `expected_subtree_hash` is equal to the trusted subtree's hash. Return success if it matches and failure if it does not.

1. Otherwise, check that the MTCProof's `signatures` contain a sufficient set of valid signatures from cosigners to satisfy the relying party's cosigner requirements ({{trusted-cosigners}}). Unrecognized cosigners MUST be ignored.

   Signatures are verified as described in {{signature-format}}. For each signature verification, the CosignedMessage structure is constructed as follows:

   1. Set the CosignedMessage's `cosigner_name` based on the cosigner ID as described in {{signature-format}}.
   1. Set the CosignedMessage's `timestamp` to zero.
   1. Set the CosignedMessage's `log_origin` based on `log_id` as described in {{signature-format}}.
   1. Set the CosignedMessage's `start` and `end` to the MTCProof's `start` and `end`, respectively.
   1. Set the CosignedMessage's `subtree_hash` to `expected_subtree_hash`.

This procedure only replaces the signature verification portion of X.509 path validation. The relying party MUST continue to perform other checks, such as checking expiry.

In this procedure, `entry_hash` can equivalently be computed in a single pass from the DER-encoded TBSCertificate, without storing the full TBSCertificateLogEntry or MTCLogEntry in memory:

1. Initialize a hash instance.
1. Write the octet 0x00 to the hash. This is the domain separator for leaf nodes.
1. Write the `extensions` field from the MTCProof to the hash.
1. Write the big-endian, two-byte `tbs_cert_entry` value to the hash.
1. Write the TBSCertificate's `version`, `issuer`, `validity`, and `subject` fields to the hash.
1. Write the `subjectPublicKeyInfo`'s `algorithm` field to the hash.
1. Write the octet 0x04 to the hash. This is an OCTET STRING identifier.
1. Write the octet L to the hash, where L is the hash length. (This assumes L is at most 127.)
1. Write H to the hash, where H is the hash of the entire `subjectPublicKeyInfo` field.
1. Write the remainder of the TBSCertificate contents octets to the hash, starting just after the `subjectPublicKeyInfo` field.
1. Finalize the hash and set `entry_hash` to the result.

This is possible because the structure in {{log-entries}} omits the TBSCertificateLogEntry's identifier and length octets.

## Trusted Cosigners

A relying party's cosigner policy determines the sets of cosigners that must sign a view of the issuance log before it is trusted.

This document does not prescribe a particular policy, but gives general guidance. Relying parties MAY implement policies other than those described below, and MAY incorporate cosigners acting in roles not described in this document.

In picking trusted cosigners, the relying party SHOULD ensure the following security properties:

Authenticity:
: The relying party only accepts entries certified by the CA

Transparency:
: The relying party only accepts entries that are publicly accessible, so that monitors, particularly the subject of the certificate, can notice any unauthorized certificates

Relying parties SHOULD ensure authenticity by requiring a signature from the CA cosigner key. This is analogous to the signature in a directly-signed X.509 certificate. If the relying party obtains CA information from a CA certificate, the CA cosigner key is determined as in {{relying-party-configuration}}.

While a CA signature is sufficient to prove a subtree came from the CA, this is not enough to ensure the certificate is visible to monitors. A misbehaving CA might not operate the log correctly, either presenting inconsistent versions of the log to relying parties and monitors, or refusing to publish some entries.

To mitigate this, relying parties SHOULD ensure transparency by requiring a quorum of signatures from additional cosigners. At minimum, these cosigners SHOULD enforce a consistent view of the log. For example, {{TLOG-WITNESS}} describes a lightweight "witness" cosigner role that checks this with consistency proofs. This is not sufficient to ensure durable logging. {{revoked-ranges}} discusses mitigations for this. Alternatively, a relying party MAY require that cosigners serve a copy of the log, in addition to enforcing a consistent view. For example, {{TLOG-MIRROR}} describes a "mirror" cosigner role.

Relying parties MAY accept the same set of additional cosigners across CAs.

In applications that do not enforce transparency requirements, a relying party MAY implement a policy that only checks for a signature from the CA cosigner. This fits the pattern of many existing X.509 applications, where CA information is determined directly from a CA certificate, with no additional out-of-band information. Unrecognized cosignatures are ignored, so such applications can interoperate with certificates issued for transparency-enforcing applications that require additional cosigners.

Cosigner roles are extensible without changes to certificate verification itself. Future specifications and individual deployments MAY define other cosigner roles to incorporate in relying party policies.

{{choosing-cosigners}} discusses additional deployment considerations in cosigner selection.

## Trusted Subtrees

As an optional optimization, a relying party MAY incorporate a periodically updated, predistributed list of trusted subtrees from the CA's current issuance log. This allows the relying party to accept landmark-relative certificates ({{landmark-relative-certificates}}) constructed against those subtrees.

Each trusted subtree contains:

* The log number of the containing log
* The `start` and `end` values that define the subtree
* The hash of the subtree

Trusted subtrees for a given log are determined by its active landmark subtrees, as described in {{landmark-tree-sizes}}. Before configuring the subtrees as trusted, the relying party MUST obtain assurance that each subtree is consistent with checkpoints observed by a sufficient set of cosigners (see {{cosigners}}) to meet its cosigner requirements. It is not necessary that the cosigners have generated signatures over the specific subtrees, only that they are consistent.

This criterion can be checked given:

* Some *reference checkpoint* that contains the latest landmark
* For each cosigner, either:
  * A cosignature on the reference checkpoint
  * A cosigned checkpoint containing the referenced checkpoint and a valid Merkle consistency proof ({{Section 2.1.4 of !RFC9162}}) between the two
* For each subtree, a valid subtree consistency proof ({{subtree-consistency-proofs}}) between the subtree and the reference checkpoint

[[TODO: The subtree consistency proofs have many nodes in common. It is possible to define a single "bulk consistency proof" that verifies all the hashes at once, but it's a lot more complex.]]

This document does not prescribe how relying parties obtain this information. A relying party MAY, for example, use an application-specific update service, such as the services described in {{CHROMIUM}} and {{FIREFOX}}. If the relying party considers the service sufficiently trusted (e.g. if the service provides the trust anchor list or certificate validation software), it MAY trust the update service to perform these checks.

The relying party SHOULD incorporate its trusted subtree configuration in application-protocol-specific certificate selection mechanisms, to allow an authenticating party to select a landmark-relative certificate. The trust anchor IDs of the landmarks may be used as efficient identifiers in the application protocol. {{use-in-tls}} discusses how to do this in TLS {{!RFC9846}}.

## Revoked Ranges

For each supported Merkle Tree CA, the relying party maintains a list of revoked ranges of serial numbers. This can be used to revoke both ranges of entries in an issuance log and ranges of issuance logs, even if the contents are not known.

When a relying party is first configured to trust an issuance log, it SHOULD be configured to revoke all serial numbers before the first available unexpired certificate at the time. This revocation SHOULD be periodically updated as entries expire. If using the format defined in {{representing-certification-authorities}}, this can be configured with the `minSerial` value.

This revocation allows the rest of a PKI to disregard old entries, even if they are not known to be expired. In particular:

* A relying party could permit a CA to skip serving old entries (see {{publishing-logs}}) if long-expired and revoked.

* Newly-established monitors can skip processing long-expired and revoked entries.

A relying party with transparency requirements additionally SHOULD revoke all log numbers above some threshold to bound monitoring overhead. If using the format defined in {{representing-certification-authorities}}, this can be configured with the `maxSerial` value. See {{limiting-issuance-logs}}.

A misbehaving CA might correctly construct a globally consistent log, but refuse to make some entries or intermediate nodes available. Consistency proofs between checkpoints and subtrees would pass, but monitors cannot observe the entries themselves. Relying parties whose cosigner policies ({{trusted-cosigners}}) do not require durable logging (e.g. via {{TLOG-MIRROR}}) are particularly vulnerable to this. In this case, the indices of the missing entries will still be known, so relying parties can use this mechanism to revoke the unknown entries, possibly as an initial, targeted mitigation before complete CA removal.

When a CA is found to be untrustworthy, relying parties SHOULD remove trust in that CA. To minimize the compatibility impact of this mitigation, index-based revocation can be used to only distrust entries after some index, while leaving existing entries accepted. This is analogous to the {{SCTNotAfter}} mechanism used in some PKIs.

The revocation mechanism in this section is complementary to certificate-level revocation mechanisms. Because log entries are uniquely identified by their serial number and issuer, existing revocation mechanisms like CRLs {{!RFC5280}} and OCSP {{!RFC6960}} apply unchanged.

# Use in TLS

Most X.509 fields such as subjectPublicKeyInfo and X.509 extensions such as subjectAltName are unmodified in Merkle Tree certificates. They apply to TLS-based applications as in any X.509 certificate. The primary new considerations for use in TLS are:

* Whether the authenticating party should send a certificate from one Merkle Tree CA, another Merkle Tree CA, or a directly-signing X.509 CA
* Whether the authenticating party should send a standalone or landmark-relative certificate
* What the relying party should communicate to the authenticating party to help it make this decision

Certificate selection in TLS, described in {{Section 4.5.1.2 of !RFC9846}}, incorporates both explicit relying-party-provided information in the ClientHello and CertificateRequest messages and implicit deployment-specific assumptions. This section describes a RECOMMENDED integration of Merkle Tree certificates into TLS trust anchor IDs ({{!I-D.ietf-tls-trust-anchor-ids}}), but applications MAY use application-specific criteria in addition to, or instead of, this recommendation.

## Standalone Certificates {#standalone-certificates-tls}

Authenticating and relying parties SHOULD use the `trust_anchors` extension to determine whether a standalone certificate would be acceptable. A standalone certificate has a trust anchor ID of the corresponding CA ID ({{ca-ids}}). This trust anchor ID is additionally contained in the trust anchor groups defined in {{single-log-landmark-groups}}.

CA IDs MAY be incorporated into other trust anchor groups, following the guidance in {{Section 5 of !I-D.ietf-tls-trust-anchor-ids}}.

[[TODO: Ideally we would negotiate cosigners. https://github.com/tlswg/tls-trust-anchor-ids/issues/54 has a sketch of how one might do this, though other designs are possible. Negotiating cosigners allows the ecosystem to manage cosigners efficiently, without needing to collect every possible cosignature and send them all at once. This is wasteful, particularly with post-quantum algorithms.]]

A standalone certificate MAY also be sent without explicit relying party trust signals, however doing so means the authenticating party implicitly assumes the relying party trusts the issuing CA. This may be viable if, for example, the CA is relatively ubiquitous among supported relying parties.

## Landmark-Relative Certificates {#landmark-relative-certificates-tls}

An authenticating party SHOULD NOT send a landmark-relative certificate without a signal that the relying party trusts the corresponding landmark subtree. Even if the relying party is assumed to trust the issuing CA, the relying party may not have sufficiently up-to-date trusted subtrees.

TLS implementations SHOULD use the `trust_anchors` extension to determine this. A landmark-relative certificate's trust anchor ID is the concatenation of the following OID components:

* The CA ID {{ca-ids}} of the CA that issued the certificate
* The constant 1
* The log number of the log used to construct the certificate
* The landmark number of the landmark used to construct the certificate

For example, the trust anchor ID for landmark 42 of CA `32473.1` and log number `8` is `32473.1.1.8.42`.

These trust anchor IDs are used when it is necessary to identify an individual landmark, e.g. as in the retry mechanism described in {{Section 4.3 of !I-D.ietf-tls-trust-anchor-ids}}. To more efficiently express a relying party's complete landmark state, these IDs are contained in trust anchor groups defined in {{single-log-landmark-groups}}, which allow relying parties to express their landmark state with a single ID.

If both a landmark-relative and a standalone certificate are usable, an authenticating party SHOULD preferentially use the landmark-relative certificate. A landmark-relative certificate asserts the same information as its standalone counterpart, but is expected to be smaller.

### Single-Log Landmark Groups

Relying parties support many landmarks per log at a time. To compactly represent this, each log ID implicitly defines a series of trust anchor groups ({{Section 5 of !I-D.ietf-tls-trust-anchor-ids}}) called *landmark groups*.

For each Merkle Tree Certificates CA, each log number `N`, and each landmark number `L`, a landmark group is defined. The group's ID is the concatenation of the following OID components:

* The CA ID {{ca-ids}} of the CA
* The constant 2
* The log number `N`
* The landmark number `L`

This group contains the following trust anchors:

* The CA ID itself (see {{standalone-certificates-tls}})
* Each landmark of log `N` from `L - max_active_landmarks + 1` to `L`, inclusive

Landmark-relative certificates SHOULD be configured with this information, as in {{Section 3.2 of !I-D.ietf-tls-trust-anchor-ids}}. A relying party whose latest trusted subtree ({{trusted-subtrees}}) in log `N` is landmark `L` SHOULD configure the `trust_anchors` extension to advertise the above landmark group. This signals support for both standalone certificates and supported landmarks.

For example, a relying party which is up-to-date as of landmark 42 of log 8 of CA `32473.1` would send an ID of `32473.1.2.8.42`.


### Timestamped Landmark Groups

Landmark groups for a single CA, described above, allow relying parties to advertise one ID per supported CA. Depending on the number of trust anchors, this can be sufficient to efficiently represent relying party state.

When needed, {{Section 5 of !I-D.ietf-tls-trust-anchor-ids}} describes how PKIs requiring further size savings can use trust anchor groups that span multiple CA instances. For example, a single ID may signal support for a group of CAs across one or more CA operators. This section describes how such groups can be applied to landmarks, using a variation of the versioning construction described in {{Section 5.1 of !I-D.ietf-tls-trust-anchor-ids}}.

Trust anchor groups containing landmarks SHOULD define versions predictably based on the time. For example, if the contained CAs allocate landmarks roughly hourly, the trust anchor group might increment the version component every hour. Each given version of the group SHOULD contain the active landmarks as of the corresponding timestamp.

This predictable cadence allows the CA to construct trust anchor group inclusions ({{Section 7.2 of !I-D.ietf-tls-trust-anchor-ids}}) for issued certificates without additional coordination. Conversely, a relying party MAY send a version if its trusted subtrees ({{trusted-subtrees}}) are up-to-date for all contained CAs, as of the version's timestamp.

In some cases, the relying party's trusted subtrees may only be partially up-to-date. The relying party, or its update service, may be unable to reach one CA in the group, e.g. due to a transient outage. This complicates timestamp-based strategies:

* If the relying party sends the group with an older timestamp, it will not signal its up-to-date state for the reachable CAs. This means a single unreachable CA can disrupt service for certificates issued by unrelated CAs.

* If the relying party sends the group with a newer timestamp, the relying party may signal support for landmarks it does not have. This risks connection failures. If the unreachable CA issued recent landmark-relative certificates, those certificates will fail validation.

The relying party can mitigate this in a number of ways:

* If the trust anchor group consists of CAs from the same operator, waiting until all CAs are reachable will be minimally disruptive.

* The relying party can opt to send the group with an older timestamp, combined with other, smaller groups at newer timestamps to better describe its state.

* A client relying party can send the newer timestamp and, in the event the unreachable CA did issue recent landmark-relative certificates, rely on the retry mechanism described in {{Section 4.3 of !I-D.ietf-tls-trust-anchor-ids}} to recover from any signaling failures.

# ACME Extensions

This section describes how to issue Merkle Tree certificates using ACME {{!RFC8555}}.

## Optional Certificates

{{Section 7.4.2 of !RFC8555}} describes how an ACME server uses the "alternate" link relation {{!RFC8288}} to serve multiple certificate chains for an ACME order. An ACME client might fetch all of them and deploy them in the authenticating party. Different relying parties need different chains, so the ACME client might reasonably treat any unavailable alternate as an error.

This behavior is not ideal for a landmark-relative certificate, which is available asynchronously and is not intended to delay the corresponding standalone certificate. This section defines the "acme-optional-alternate" link relation. When serving a certificate, an ACME server MAY provide one or more link relation header fields of type "acme-optional-alternate". "acme-optional-alternate" identifies an alternate certificate chain, but one that is optional. Relying parties that accept the optional alternate are expected to also accept either the original certificate chain or chains served under the "alternate" link relation. If the certificate chain is not yet available, the "acme-optional-alternate" URL SHOULD serve an HTTP 202 (Accepted) response, with a Retry-After header ({{Section 10.2.3 of !RFC9110}}) estimating when it will become available.

An ACME client MAY fetch these URLs to collect additional alternate certificate chains. If the resource is unavailable, the ACME client SHOULD NOT fail the overall transaction. If the resource returns an HTTP 202 (Accepted) response, the ACME client SHOULD retry the request later, according to the Retry-After header, but this process SHOULD be independent of deploying other chains in the ACME order. In particular, if deploying a new service, the ACME client SHOULD NOT block deployment on optional alternates.

If renewing certificates, the ACME client MAY opt to wait for optional alternates to simplify certificate replacement, but only while the previous certificates remain valid.

## Using ACME with Merkle Tree Certificates

When downloading the certificate ({{Section 7.4.2 of !RFC8555}}), ACME clients supporting Merkle Tree certificates SHOULD send "application/pem-certificate-chain-with-properties" in their Accept header ({{Section 12.5.1 of !RFC9110}}). ACME servers issuing Merkle Tree certificates SHOULD then respond with that content type and include trust anchor ID information as described in {{Section 7 of !I-D.ietf-tls-trust-anchor-ids}}. {{use-in-tls}} describes the trust anchor ID assignments for standalone and landmark-relative certificates.

When processing an order for a Merkle Tree certificate, the ACME server moves the order to the "valid" state after the corresponding entry is sequenced in the issuance log, cosignatures are collected, and the standalone certificate is available. The order's certificate URL then serves the standalone certificate, constructed as described in {{standalone-certificates}}.

The standalone certificate response SHOULD additionally carry an "acme-optional-alternate" URL for the landmark-relative certificate. It initially serves an HTTP 202 response, as described in {{optional-certificates}}. Once the next landmark is allocated, the ACME server constructs a landmark-relative certificate, as described in {{landmark-relative-certificates}}, and serves it from the URL.

# Deployment Considerations

## Operational Costs

### Certification Authority Costs

While Merkle Tree certificates expect CAs to operate logs, the costs of these logs are expected to be much lower than a CT log from {{?RFC6962}} or {{?RFC9162}}:

{{publishing-logs}} does not constrain the API to the one defined in {{?RFC6962}} or {{?RFC9162}}. If the PKI uses a tile-based protocol, such as {{TLOG-TILES}} (profiled for Merkle Tree Certificates in {{MTC-TLOG}}), the issuance log benefits from the improved caching properties of such designs.

Unlike a CT log, an issuance log does not have public submission APIs. Log entries are only added by the CA directly. Costs are thus expected to scale with the CA's own issuance.

A CA only needs to produce a digital signature for every checkpoint, rather than for every certificate. The lower signature rate requirements could allow more secure and/or economical key storage choices.

Individual entries are kept small and do not scale with public key or signature sizes. This mitigates growth from post-quantum algorithms. Public keys in entries are replaced with fixed-sized hashes. There are no signatures in entries themselves, and only signatures on the very latest checkpoint are retained. Every new checkpoint completely subsumes the old checkpoint, so there is no need to retain older signatures. Likewise, a subtree is only signed if contained in another signed checkpoint.

Explicit revocation of old entries ({{revoked-ranges}}) allows a long-lived log to serve only the more recent entries, scaling with the size of the retention window, rather than the log's total lifetime.

Mirrors of the log can also reduce CA bandwidth costs, because monitors can fetch data from mirrors instead of CAs directly. In PKIs that deploy mirrors as part of cosigner policies, relying parties could set few availability requirements on CAs, as described in {{log-availability}}.

### Cosigner Costs

The costs of cosigners vary by cosigner role. A consistency-checking cosigner, such as {{TLOG-WITNESS}}, requires very little state and can be run with low cost.

A mirroring cosigner, such as {{TLOG-MIRROR}}, performs a role comparable to CT logs, but several of the cost-saving properties in {{certification-authority-costs}} also apply: improved protocols, smaller entries, less frequent signatures, and partial log serving. While a mirror does need to accommodate another party's (the CA's) growth rate, it grows only from new issuances from that one CA. If one CA's issuance rate exceeds the mirror's capacity, that does not impact the mirror's copies of other CAs. Mirrors also do not need to defend against a client uploading a large number of existing certificates all at once. Submissions are naturally batched and serialized.

### Monitor Costs

In a CT-based PKI, every log carries a potentially distinct subset of active certificates. Monitors must check the contents of every CT log. At the same time, certificates are commonly synchronized between CT logs. As a result, a monitor will typically download each certificate multiple times, once for every log. In Merkle Tree Certificates, each entry appears in exactly one log. A relying party might require a log to be covered by a quorum of mirrors, but each mirror is cryptographically verified to serve the same contents. Once a monitor has obtained some entry from one mirror, it does not need to download it from the others.

In addition to downloading each entry only once, the entries themselves are smaller, as discussed in {{certification-authority-costs}}.

## Choosing Cosigners

In selecting trusted cosigners and cosigner requirements ({{trusted-cosigners}}), relying parties navigate a number of trade-offs:

A consistency-checking cosigner, such as {{TLOG-WITNESS}}, is inexpensive to run, but does not guarantee durable logging. A mirroring cosigner is more expensive and may take longer to cosign structures. Requiring a mirror signature provides stronger guarantees to the relying party, which in turn can reduce the requirements on CAs (see {{log-availability}}), however it may cause certificate issuance to take longer. That said, mirrors are comparable to CT logs, if not cheaper (see {{operational-costs}}), so they may be appropriate in PKIs where running CT logs is already viable.

Relying parties that require larger quorums of trusted cosigners can reduce the trust placed in any individual cosigner. However, larger quorums result in larger, more expensive standalone certificates. The cost of standalone certificates will depend on how frequently the landmark optimization occurs in a given PKI. Conversely, relying parties that require smaller quorums have smaller standalone certificates, but place more trust in their cosigners.

Relying party policies also impact monitor operation. If a relying party accepts any one of three cosigners, monitors SHOULD check the checkpoints of all three. Otherwise, a malicious CA may send different split views to different cosigners. More generally, monitors SHOULD check the checkpoints in the union of all cosigners trusted by all supported relying parties. This is an efficient check because, if the CA is operating correctly, all cosigners will observe the same tree. Thus the monitor only needs to check consistency proofs between the checkpoints, and check the log contents themselves once. Monitors MAY also rely on other parties in the transparency ecosystem to perform this check.

## Log Availability

CAs and mirrors are expected to serve their log contents over HTTP. It is possible for the contents to be unavailable, either due to temporary service outage or because the log does not serve long-expired entries. If some resources are unavailable, they may not be visible to monitors.

As in CT, PKIs that deploy Merkle Tree certificates SHOULD establish availability policies. These policies SHOULD be adhered to by trusted CAs and mirrors, and enforced by relying party vendors as a condition of trust. Exact availability policies for these services are out of scope for this document, but this section provides some general guidance.

Availability policies MAY permit CAs and mirrors to stop serving old, long-expired entries. If so, such policies SHOULD, at minimum, require CAs and mirrors to retain entries until they have been revoked in up-to-date relying parties. See {{revoked-ranges}} for details. This is analogous to the CT practice of temporal sharding {{CHROME-CT}}, except the issuance log remains compatible with older, unupdated relying parties.

PKIs that require mirror cosignatures ({{trusted-cosigners}}) can impose minimal to no availability requirements on CAs without compromising transparency goals. If a CA never makes an entry available, mirrors will be unable to update. This will prevent relying parties from accepting the undisclosed entries. However, a CA that is persistently unavailable may not offer sufficient benefit to be used by authenticating parties or trusted by relying parties.

However, if a mirror's interface becomes unavailable, monitors may be unable to check for unauthorized issuance, if the entries are not available in another mirror. This does compromise transparency goals. As such, availability policies SHOULD set availability expectations on mirrors. This can also be mitigated by using multiple mirrors, either directly enforced in cosigner requirements, or by keeping mirrors up-to-date with each other.

In PKIs that do not require mirroring cosigners, the CA's serving endpoint is more crucial for monitors. Such PKIs SHOULD set availability requirements on CAs.

In each of these cases, the serial numbers of unavailable entries are known. Availability failures can thus be mitigated by revocation, as described in {{revoked-ranges}}, likely as a first step in a broader distrust.

## Certificate Renewal

When an authenticating party requests a certificate, the landmark-relative certificate will not be available until the next landmark is ready. From there, the landmark-relative certificate will not be available until relying parties receive new trusted subtrees.

To maximize coverage of landmark-relative certificates, authenticating parties performing routine renewal SHOULD request a new Merkle Tree certificate before the previous Merkle Tree certificate expires. Renewing around 75% of the way through the previous certificate's lifetime is RECOMMENDED. Authenticating parties additionally SHOULD retain both the new and old certificates in the certificate set until the old certificate expires. As the new subtrees are delivered to relying parties, certificate negotiation will transition relying parties to the new certificate, while retaining the old certificate for relying parties that are not yet updated.

The above also applies if the authenticating party is performing a routine key rotation alongside the routine renewal. In this case, certificate negotiation would pick the key as part of the certificate selection. This slightly increases the lifetime of the old key but maintains the size optimization continuously.

If the service is rotating keys in response to a key compromise, this option is not appropriate. Instead, the service SHOULD immediately discard the old key and request a standalone certificate and the revocation of the previous certificate. This will interrupt the size optimization until the new landmark-relative certificate is available and relying parties are updated.

# Privacy Considerations

The Privacy Considerations described in {{Section 9 of !I-D.ietf-tls-trust-anchor-ids}} apply to their use with Merkle Tree Certificates.

In particular, relying parties that share an update process for trusted subtrees ({{trusted-subtrees}}) will fetch the same stream of updates. However, updates may reach different users at different times, resulting in some variation across users. This variation may contribute to a fingerprinting attack {{?RFC6973}}. If the Merkle Tree CA trust anchors are sent unconditionally in `trust_anchors`, this variation will be passively observable. If they are sent conditionally, e.g. with the DNS mechanism, the trust anchor list will require active probing.

# Security Considerations

## Authenticity

A key security requirement of any PKI scheme is that relying parties only accept assertions that were certified by a trusted certification authority. Merkle Tree certificates achieve this by ensuring the relying party only accepts authentic subtree hashes:

* In standalone certificates, the relying party's cosigner requirements ({{trusted-cosigners}}) are expected to include some signature by the CA's cosigner. The CA's cosigner ({{certification-authority-cosigners}}) is defined to certify the contents of every checkpoint and subtree that it signs.

* In landmark-relative certificates, the cosigner requirements are checked ahead of time, when the trusted subtrees are predistributed ({{trusted-subtrees}}).

Given a subtree hash computed over entries that the CA certified, it must be computationally infeasible to construct an entry not on this list, and an inclusion proof, such that inclusion proof verification succeeds. This requires using a collision-resistant hash in the Merkle Tree construction.

The subject public key is itself also hashed before incorporating into the log. This hash depends on second-preimage resistance. To authorize the wrong public key for some existing log entry (e.g. one that describes a target's identity), an attacker must find some other public key with the same hash. While an attacker able to compute collisions might find two public keys with the same hash, that hash will not be in any existing log entry. The attacker would need to be authorized to request certification of a new entry with this hash. Such an attacker could only certify colliding pairs of public keys for its own identities.

## Transparency

The transparency mechanisms in this document do not prevent a CA from issuing an unauthorized certificate. Rather, they provide comparable security properties as Certificate Transparency {{?RFC9162}} in ensuring that all certificates are either rejected by relying parties, or visible to monitors and, in particular, the subject of the certificate.

Compared to Certificate Transparency, some of the responsibilities of a log have moved to the CA. All signatures generated by the CA in this system are assertions about some view of the CA's issuance log. However, a CA does not need to function correctly to ensure transparency properties. Relying parties are expected to require a quorum of additional cosigners, which together enforce properties of the log ({{trusted-cosigners}}) and prevent or detect CA misbehavior:

A CA might violate the append-only property of its log and present different views to different parties. However, each individual cosigner will only follow a single append-only view of the log history. Provided the cosigners are correctly operated, relying parties and monitors will observe consistent views. Views that were not cosigned at all may not be detected, but they also will not be accepted by relying parties.

If the CA sends one view to some cosigners and another view to other cosigners, it is possible that multiple views will be accepted by relying parties. However, in that case monitors will observe that cosigners do not match each other. Relying parties can then react by revoking the range of inconsistent serials ({{revoked-ranges}}), and likely removing the CA. If the cosigners are mirrors, the underlying entries in both views will also be visible.

A CA might correctly construct its log, but refuse to serve some unauthorized entry. The impact depends on the relying party's cosigner policy:

* If the relying party requires cosignatures from trusted mirrors, the entry will either be visible to monitors in the mirrors, or have never reached a mirror. In the latter case, the entry will not have been cosigned, so the relying party would not accept it.

* If the relying party accepts log views without a trusted mirror, the unauthorized entry may not be available. However, the existence of _some_ entry at that index will be visible, so monitors will know the CA is failing to present an entry. This is sufficient to determine the serial number, so relying parties can then react by revoking the undisclosed entries ({{revoked-ranges}}), and likely removing the CA.

### Log Failures

Merkle Tree Certificates introduce additional state to PKI deployments and thus new kinds of operational failures. CAs are required to only sign subtree hashes that are consistent with a single append-only view of each issuance log. A CA might violate this as a result of operational failures. For example:

* A CA loses some state and signs subtree hashes from two inconsistent copies of the log
* A CA miscalculates some hash and signs a subtree hash that cannot be computed from some underlying sequence of entries

As described in {{transparency}}, PKIs can use additional cosigners to provide transparency guarantees even in the face of such CA violations. In doing so, individual cosigners may be locked to only one of two views of the log or unable to sign further checkpoints because some hash's preimage is unknown. It may then no longer be possible to add entries to the log that are trusted by existing relying parties.

Whether by accident or compromise, these violations are ultimately CA failures. However, it is useful for the CA instance to remain functional during and after incident management:

* While the incident is diagnosed, authenticating parties may still need new certificates.
* If relying parties consider the CA operator and the CA instance still trustworthy, repairing the incident without changing the CA requires less overhead.
* If relying parties consider either the CA operator or the CA instance no longer trustworthy and in need of replacement, the CA may still be needed to serve older, unupdated relying parties.

This is mitigated by a CA instance consisting of a series of issuance logs ({{issuance-logs}}). After a log failure, the CA SHOULD increment its current issuance log to restore availability. Both the underlying log failure and the use of a new issuance log will be visible to monitors and SHOULD be treated as a PKI incident. Such PKI incidents can be handled by some combination of:

* Revoking the diverging log indices ({{revoked-ranges}})
* Reevaluating trusted CAs and, if necessary, removing the old CA instance and switching to a new CA instance

In the latter case, the CA operator MAY continue to operate the removed CA instance if, for example, there remain unupdated relying parties that require it.

### Limiting Issuance Logs

While multiple issuance logs help mitigate log failures, as described in {{log-failures}}, they introduce transparency risks. If a CA violates the requirement to only use one issuance log at a time, it might add an entry in some far future log number. To be accepted in transparency-enforcing relying parties, the log state must still be cosigned. However, monitors may not know which log numbers to monitor.

PKIs with transparency requirements SHOULD mitigate this by only accepting a limited range of log numbers in relying parties, transparency cosigners, or both. This limit MAY be set to a fixed value or a rolling value that is updated whenever the CA switches its current log. Fixed values require committing to a limit of recoverable log failures over the lifetime of a CA.

Log number limits in relying parties can be implemented by revoking all serial numbers above some threshold. (See {{revoked-ranges}}.) If using the format described in {{representing-certification-authorities}}, this can be implemented with the `maxSerial` field.

## Public Key Hashes

Unlike Certificate Transparency, the mechanisms in this document do not provide the subject public keys, only the hashed values. This is intended to reduce log serving costs, particularly with large post-quantum keys. As a result, monitors look for unrecognized hashes instead of unrecognized keys. Any unrecognized hash, even if the preimage is unknown, indicates an unauthorized certificate.

This optimization complicates studies of weak public keys, e.g. {{SharedFactors}}. Such studies will have to retrieve the public keys separately, such as by connecting to the TLS servers, or fetching from the CA if it retains the unhashed key. This document does not define a mechanism for doing this, or require that CAs or mirrors retain unhashed keys. The transparency mechanisms in this protocol are primarily intended to allow monitors to observe certificate issuance.

## Non-Repudiation

When a monitor finds an unauthorized certificate issuance in a log or mirror, it must be possible to prove the CA indeed certified the information in the entry. However, only the latest signed checkpoint may be retained by the transparency ecosystem, so it may not be possible to reconstruct the exact certificate seen by relying parties.

However, per {{certification-authority-cosigners}}, any subtree signature is a binding assertion by the CA that it has certified every entry in the subtree. Thus, given *any* signed checkpoint that contains the unauthorized entry, a Merkle inclusion proof ({{Section 2.1.3 of ?RFC9162}}) is sufficient to prove the CA issued the entry. This is analogous to how, in {{Section 3.2.1 of ?RFC9162}}, CAs are held accountable for signed CT precertificates.

The transparency ecosystem does not retain unhashed public keys, so it also may not be possible to construct a complete certificate from the signed checkpoint and inclusion proof. However, if the log entry's `subjectPublicKeyInfoHash` does not correspond to an authorized key for the subject of the certificate, the entry is still unauthorized. A Merkle Tree CA is held responsible for all log entries it certifies, whether or not the preimage of the hash is known.

## Extensibility

MTCLogEntry ({{log-entries}}) contains several extension points:

* New X.509 extensions can be added to TBSCertificateLogEntry.
* New MTCLogEntryType values define new formats for the entry contents.
* New MTCLogEntryExtensionType values define new entry extension fields.

X.509 extensions apply to Merkle Tree Certificates without any modifications. The two entry-level extension points are new to this protocol. Older CAs, cosigners, relying parties, and monitors may encounter unrecognized entries:

Different cosigner roles interact with extensions differently. Some roles, e.g. {{TLOG-MIRROR}} and {{TLOG-WITNESS}}, do not interpret entry contents. Unrecognized extensions do not impact these roles. Other roles, such as CA cosigners, have semantics that depend on the entry contents. If a cosigner role interprets log entry contents, it MUST define how it interacts with unrecognized types and extensions.

{{certification-authority-cosigners}} forbids a CA from logging or signing entries that it does not recognize. A CA cannot faithfully claim to certify information if it does not understand it. This is analogous to how a correctly-operated X.509 CA can never sign an unrecognized X.509 extension.

Unrecognized entry types do not impact older relying parties. In {{verifying-certificate-signatures}}, the relying party constructs the MTCLogEntry that it expects. The unrecognized entry will have a different `type` value, so the proof will never succeed, assuming the underlying hash function remains collision-resistant.

However, unrecognized entry extensions will be ignored by relying parties, analogously to a non-critical X.509 extension. Entry extensions thus SHOULD be defined so that this is safe.

If a monitor observes an entry with unknown type or entry extension, it may not be able to determine if it is of interest. For example, it may be unable to tell whether it covers some relevant DNS name. Until the monitor is updated to reflect the current state of the PKI, the monitor may be unable to detect all misissued certificates.

This situation is analogous to the addition of a new X.509 extension. When relying parties add support for log entry types or new X.509 extensions, they SHOULD coordinate with monitors to ensure the transparency ecosystem is able to monitor the new formats.

## Certificate Malleability

An ASN.1 structure like X.509's Certificate is an abstract data type that is independent of its serialization. There are multiple encoding rules for ASN.1. Commonly, protocols use DER {{X.690}}, such as {{Section 4.5.1 of ?RFC9846}}. This aligns with {{Section 4.1.1.3 of ?RFC5280}}, which says X.509 signatures are computed over the DER-encoded TBSCertificate. After signature verification, applications can assume the DER-encoded TBSCertificate is not malleable.

When the signature verification process in {{verifying-certificate-signatures}} first transforms the TBSCertificate into a TBSCertificateLogEntry, it preserves this non-malleability. There is a unique valid DER encoding for every abstract TBSCertificate structure, so malleability of the DER-encoded TBSCertificate reduces to malleability of the TBSCertificate value:

* The `version`, `issuer`, `validity`, `subject`, `issuerUniqueID`, `subjectUniqueID`, and `extensions` fields are copied from the TBSCertificate to the TBSCertificateLogEntry unmodified, so they are directly authenticated by the inclusion proof.

* `serialNumber` is omitted from TBSCertificateLogEntry, but its value determines the inclusion proof index, which authenticates it.

* The redundant `signature` field in TBSCertificate is omitted from TBSCertificateLogEntry, but {{verifying-certificate-signatures}} checks for an exact value, so no other values are possible.

* `subjectPublicKeyInfo` is hashed as `subjectPublicKeyInfoHash` in TBSCertificateLogEntry. Provided the underlying hash function is collision-resistant, no other values are possible for a given log entry.

X.509 implementations often implement {{Section 4.1.1.3 of ?RFC5280}} by equivalently retaining the original received DER encoding, rather than recomputing the canonical DER encoding TBSCertificate. This optimization is compatible with the assumptions above.

Some non-conforming X.509 implementations use a BER {{X.690}} parser instead of DER, and then apply this optimization to the received BER encoding. BER encoding is not unique, so this does not produce the same result. In such implementations, the BER-encoded TBSCertificate becomes also non-malleable, and applications may rely on this. To preserve this property in Merkle Tree Certificates, such non-conforming implementations MUST do the following when implementing {{verifying-certificate-signatures}}:

* Reparse the initial identifier (the SEQUENCE tag) and length octets of the TBSCertificate structure with a conforming DER parser and fail verification if invalid.

* When copying the `version`, `issuer`, `validity`, `subject`, `issuerUniqueID`, `subjectUniqueID`, and `extensions` fields, either copy over the observed BER encodings, or reparse each field with a conforming DER parser and fail verification if invalid.

* Reparse the `serialNumber` field with a conforming DER parser and fail verification if invalid.

* Reparse the `signature` field with a conforming DER parser and fail verification if invalid. Equivalently, check for an exact equality with the expected, DER-encoded value.

* When hashing `subjectPublicKeyInfo`, either hash the observed BER encoding, or reparse the structure with a conforming DER parser and fail verification if invalid.

These additional checks are redundant in X.509 implementations that use a conforming DER parser.

{{log-entries}} requires that the TBSCertificateLogEntry in an MTCLogEntry be DER-encoded, so applying a stricter parser will be compatible with conforming CAs. While these existing non-conforming implementations may be unable to switch to a DER parser due to compatibility concerns, Merkle Tree Certificates are new, so there is no existing deployment of malformed BER-encoded TBSCertificateLogEntry structures.

The above only ensures the TBSCertificate portion is non-malleable. In Merkle Tree Certificates, similar to an ECDSA X.509 signature, the signature value is malleable. Multiple MTCProof structures may prove a single TBSCertificate structure. Additionally, in all X.509-based protocols, a BER-based parser for the outer, unsigned Certificate structure will admit malleability in those portions of the encoding. Applications that derive a unique identifier from the Certificate MUST instead use the TBSCertificate, or some portion of it, for Merkle Tree Certificates.

## Revocation

This document does not define a new certificate-level revocation mechanism. Existing mechanisms like CRLs and OCSP apply unchanged to Merkle Tree certificates. The sequential serial numbers assigned by issuance logs may enable future improvements to revocation, but such work is out of scope for this document.

## Signature Domain Separation

The signature format defined in {{signature-format}} includes a fixed label prefix to ensure domain separation. Provided other uses of the same key use a non-overlapping prefix, signatures in one context cannot be substituted for those in another.

{{certification-authority-cosigners}} permits a CA cosigner key to be used to sign CRLs and OCSP responses. These signatures do not include a domain separation prefix. Instead, X.509 relies on an undocumented assumption that the TBSCertificate, TBSCertList, and OCSP ResponseData structures do not overlap at the level of individual ASN.1 fields.

These ASN.1 structures all begin with a SEQUENCE tag, which is encoded in DER as 0x30 or the ASCII digit "0". The domain separation label used in {{signature-format}}, `subtree/v1\n\0`, does not begin with "0", so their inputs do not overlap. More generally, this label is not a prefix of any DER or BER encoding.

Domain separation analysis based on the structures themselves is fragile, particularly when individual ASN.1 fields must be analyzed. This document depends on a structure-level analysis for CRLs and OCSP responses due to how these legacy protocols were defined. Future uses of the key SHOULD use a more robust mechanism, namely a fixed label prefix or a context string parameter if the signature scheme supports it.

## Subordinate Certification Authorities

Merkle Tree Certificates' transparency properties only apply to certificates directly issued by the CA, not certification paths. The CA might issue a certificate that describes an unconstrained, subordinate, non-MTC CA. Certificates issued by the subordinate CA would not be visible in the MTC CA's issuance log and thus may not be visible to monitors. However, the subordinate CA certificate that enables this bypass will still be visible in the issuance logs.

Although the scope is larger, this scenario is similar to an unauthorized end-entity certificate and can be handled analogously:

Relying parties with transparency requirements SHOULD define policy requirements on trusted CAs that prevent these bypasses, with any violation treated as an unauthorized certificate. For example, a relying party might require that all subordinate CAs have name constraints ({{Section 4.2.1.10 of !RFC5280}}) or forbid subordinate CAs entirely. In addition to holding CAs responsible for meeting these policies, relying parties SHOULD programmatically enforce these policies as part of certification path validation.

Monitors SHOULD monitor for adherence to applicable policies as part of monitoring for unauthorized certificates. For example, a monitor that looks for entries covering `example.com` SHOULD look for either a subject alternative name ({{Section 4.2.1.6 of !RFC5280}}) of `example.com` or a basic constraints ({{Section 4.2.1.9 of !RFC5280}}) extension with the cA boolean set to true.

It is not sufficient to constrain the MTC CA with a path length constraint ({{Section 4.2.1.9 of !RFC5280}}) of zero. Self-issued certificates do not contribute to path length constraints, so such an MTC CA might still issue CA certificates with the same name as itself.

# Merkle Tree Structure

This non-normative section describes how the Merkle Tree structure relates to the binary representations of indices. It is included to help implementers understand the procedures described in {{subtrees}}.

## Binary Representations

Within a Merkle Tree whose size is a power of two, the binary representation of a leaf's index gives the path to that leaf. The leaf is a left child if the least-significant bit is unset and a right child if it is set. The next bit indicates the direction of the parent node, and so on. {{fig-merkle-tree-bits-full}} demonstrates this in a Merkle Tree of size 8:

~~~aasvg
       +----------------+
       |     [0, 8)     |        level 3
       +----------------+
        /              \
   +--------+      +--------+
   | [0, 4) |      | [4, 8) |    level 2
   +--------+      +--------+
    /      \        /      \
+-----+ +-----+ +-----+ +-----+
|[0,2)| |[2,4)| |[4,6)| |[6,8)|  level 1
+-----+ +-----+ +-----+ +-----+
  / \     / \     / \     / \
+-+ +-+ +-+ +-+ +-+ +-+ +-+ +-+
|0| |1| |2| |3| |4| |5| |6| |7|  level 0
+-+ +-+ +-+ +-+ +-+ +-+ +-+ +-+
~~~
{: #fig-merkle-tree-bits-full title="An example Merkle Tree of size 8"}

The binary representation of `4` is `0b100`. It is the left (0) child of `[4, 6)`, which is the left (0) child of `[4, 8)`, which is the right (1) child of `[0, 8)`.

Each level in the tree corresponds to a bit position and can be correspondingly numbered, with 0 indicating the least-significant bit and the leaf level, and so on. In this numbering, a node's level can be determined as follows: if the node is a root of subtree `[start, end)`, the node's level is `BIT_WIDTH(end - start - 1)`.

Comparing two indices determines the relationship between two paths. The highest differing bit gives the level at which paths from root to leaf diverge. For example, the bit representations of 4 and 6 are `0b100` and `0b110`, respectively. The highest differing bit is bit 1. Bits 2 and up are the same between the two indices. This indicates that the paths from the root to leaves 4 and 6 diverge when going from level 2 to level 1.

This can be generalized to arbitrary-sized Merkle Trees. {{fig-merkle-tree-bits-partial}} depicts a Merkle Tree of size 6:

~~~aasvg
       +--------------+
       |     [0, 6)   |   level 3
       +--------------+
        /          |
   +--------+      |
   | [0, 4) |      *      level 2
   +--------+      |
    /      \       |
+-----+ +-----+ +-----+
|[0,2)| |[2,4)| |[4,6)|   level 1
+-----+ +-----+ +-----+
  / \     / \     / \
+-+ +-+ +-+ +-+ +-+ +-+
|0| |1| |2| |3| |4| |5|   level 0
+-+ +-+ +-+ +-+ +-+ +-+
~~~
{: #fig-merkle-tree-bits-partial title="An example Merkle Tree of size 6"}

When the size of a Merkle Tree is not a power of two, some levels on the rightmost edge of the tree are skipped. The rightmost edge is the path to the last element. The skipped levels can be seen in its binary representation. Here, the last element is 5, which has binary representation `0b101`. When a bit is set, the corresponding node is a right child. When it is unset, the corresponding node is skipped.

In a tree of the next power of two size, the skipped nodes in this path are where there *would* have been a right child, had there been enough elements to construct one. Without a right child, the hash operation is skipped and a skipped node has the same value as its singular child. {{fig-merkle-tree-bits-partial-comparison}} depicts this for a tree of size 6.

+-+ +-+ +-+ +-+ +-+ +-+ +-+ +-+

~~~
{: #fig-merkle-tree-bits-partial-comparison title="An example Merkle Tree of size 6, viewed as a subset of a tree of size 8"}

Zero bits also indicate skipped nodes in paths that have not yet diverged from the rightmost edge (i.e. the path to the last element), when viewed from root to leaf. In the example, the binary representation of 4 is `0b100`. While bit 0 and bit 1 are both unset, they manifest in the tree differently. Bit 0 indicates that 4 is a left child. However, at bit 1, `0b100` has not yet diverged from the last element, `0b101`. That instead indicates a skipped node, not a left child.

## Subtrees {#subtrees-explain}

Given a list of elements and Merkle Tree over them, it is possible to construct a smaller Merkle Tree over any interval of elements. However, those smaller trees may not have the same structure as the original tree.

{{fig-misaligned-tree}} shows a Merkle Tree of size 8, and a tree built over elements `[1, 5)`. When `[1, 5)` is considered as an independent, 4-element sequence, it does not align with the portion of the overall tree that covers `[1, 5)`. The two trees do not share any intermediate nodes. This prevents constructing subtree consistency proofs ({{subtree-consistency-proofs}}).

~~~aasvg

~~~
{: #fig-misaligned-tree title="An example misaligned tree"}

The numerical constraints on `start` and `end` in {{definition-of-a-subtree}} restrict subtrees to ensure that they are properly aligned with the original tree as to permit subtree consistency proofs. A Merkle Tree built over `[start, end)` has size `end - start`, and is constructed as if `start` were the first element of the sequence at index zero. To be aligned, `start` must be the leftmost leaf of the lowest common ancestor of `start` and `end - 1` in the original tree:

* Numerically, this means the least significant `BIT_WIDTH(end - start - 1)` bits of `start` must be zero. Equivalently, `start` must be divisible by `BIT_CEIL(end - start)`.

* In the tree, this means subtrees are constructed by taking any node in the tree, setting `start` to the leftmost leaf under the node, and `end` to one past any other leaf under the node.

Though most nodes overlap, not every node of the subtree is necessarily in the larger Merkle Tree, as shown in {{fig-subtree-containment-example-2}}. In general:

* Subtrees whose sizes are a power of two are called *full subtrees*. A full subtree's root node will always be in the original tree.

* Subtrees whose sizes are not a power of two are called *partial subtrees*. A partial subtree's root node will be in the original tree of size `n`, if and only if `n = end`. Otherwise, non-leaf nodes along the partial subtree's right edge will not be part of the original tree.

The difference between full and partial subtrees does not impact their usage, but they can help in understanding the proof constructions below.

## Inclusion Proof Evaluation {#inclusion-proof-evaluation-explain}

The procedure in {{evaluating-a-subtree-inclusion-proof}} builds up a subtree hash in `r` by starting from `entry_hash` and iteratively hashing elements of `inclusion_proof` on the left or right. That means this procedure, when successful, must return *some* hash that contains `entry_hash`.

Treating `[start, end)` as a Merkle Tree of size `end - start`, the procedure hashes based on the path to `index`. Within this smaller Merkle Tree, it has index `fn = index - start` (first number), and the last element has index `sn = end - start - 1` (second number).

Step 4 iterates through `inclusion_proof` and the paths to `fn` and `sn` in parallel. As the procedure right-shifts `fn` and `sn` and looks at the least-significant bit, it moves up the two paths, toward the root. When `sn` is zero, the procedure has reached the top of the tree. The procedure checks that the two iterations complete together.

Iterating from level 0 up, `fn` and `sn` will initially be different. While they are different, step 4.2 hashes on the left or right based on the binary representation, as discussed in {{binary-representations}}.

Once `fn = sn`, the remainder of the path is on the right edge. At that point, the condition in step 4.2 is always true. It only incorporates proof entries on the left, once per set bit. Unset bits are skipped.

Inclusion proofs can also be evaluated by considering these two stages separately. The first stage consumes `l1 = BIT_WIDTH(fn XOR sn)` proof entries. The second stage consumes `l2 = POPCOUNT(fn >> l1)` proof entries. A valid inclusion proof must then have `l1 + l2` entries. The first `l1` entries are hashed based on `fn`'s least significant bits, and the remaining `l2` entries are hashed on the left.

## Consistency Proof Structure

A subtree consistency proof for `[start, end)` and the tree of `n` elements is similar to an inclusion proof for element `end - 1`. If one starts from `end - 1`'s hash, incorporating the whole inclusion proof should reconstruct `root_hash` and incorporating a subset of the inclusion proof should reconstruct `node_hash`. Thus `end - 1`'s hash and this inclusion proof can prove consistency. A subtree consistency proof in this document applies two optimizations over this construction:

1. Instead of starting at level 0 with `end - 1`, the proof can start at a higher level. Any ancestor of `end - 1` shared by both the subtree and the overall tree is a valid starting node to reconstruct `node_hash` and `root_hash`. Use the highest level with a common ancestor. This truncates the inclusion proof.

2. If this starting node is the entire subtree, omit its hash from the consistency proof. The verifier is assumed to already know `node_hash`.

A Merkle consistency proof, defined in {{Section 2.1.4 of ?RFC9162}}, applies these same optimizations.

{{fig-truncate-consistency-proof}} depicts a subtree consistency proof between the subtree `[0, 6)` and the Merkle Tree of size 8. The consistency proof begins at level 1, or node `[4, 6)`. The inclusion proof portion is similarly truncated to start at level 1: `[6, 8)` and `[0, 4)`. If the consistency proof began at level 0, the starting node would be leaf 5, and the consistency proof would additionally include leaf 4.

{: #fig-truncate-consistency-proof title="A subtree consistency proof that starts at level 1 instead of level 0"}

Note that the truncated inclusion proof may include nodes from lower levels, if the corresponding level was skipped on the right edge. {{fig-truncate-consistency-proof-2}} depicts a subtree consistency proof between the subtree `[0, 6)` and the Merkle Tree of size 7. As above, the starting node is `[4, 6)` at level 1. The inclusion proof portion includes leaf 6 at level 0. This is because leaf 6 is taking the place of its skipped parent at level 1. (A skipped node can be thought of as a duplicate of its singular child.)

## Consistency Proof Verification {#consistency-proof-verification-explain}

The procedure in {{verifying-a-subtree-consistency-proof}} is structured similarly to inclusion proof evaluation ({{inclusion-proof-evaluation-explain}}). It iteratively builds two hashes, `fr` (first root) and `sr` (second root), which are expected to equal `node_hash` and `root_hash`, respectively. Everything hashed into `fr` is also hashed into `sr`, so success demonstrates that `root_hash` contains `node_hash`.

Step 2 initializes `fn` (first number), `sn` (second number), and `tn` (third number) to follow, respectively, the paths to `start`, `end - 1` (the last element of the subtree), and `n - 1` (the last element of the tree).

Steps 3 and 4 then skip to the starting node, described in {{consistency-proof-structure}}. The starting node may be:

* The entire subtree `[start, end)` if the subtree root is in the tree. This will occur if `end` is `n` (step 3), or if `[start, end)` is a full subtree (exiting step 4 because `fn` is `sn`).

* Otherwise, the highest full subtree along the right edge of `[start, end)`. This corresponds to the process exiting step 4 because `LSB(sn)` is not set.

Steps 5 and 6 initialize the hashes `fr` and `sr`:

* In the first case above, `fn` will equal `sn` after truncation. Step 5 will then initialize the hashes to `node_hash` because the consistency proof does not need to include the starting node.

* In the second case above, `fn` is less than `sn`. Step 6 will then initialize the hashes to the first value in the consistency proof.

Step 7 incorporates the remainder of the consistency proof into `fr` and `sr`:

* All hashes are incorporated into `sr`, with hashing on the left or right determined the same as in inclusion proof evaluation.

* A subset of the hashes is incorporated into `fr`. It skips any hash on the right because those contain elements greater than `end - 1`. It also stops incorporating when `fn` and `sn` have converged.

This reconstructs the hashes of the subtree and original tree, which are then compared to expected values in step 8.

In the case when `fn` is `sn` in step 5, the condition in step 7.2.1 is always false, and `fr` is always equal to `node_hash` in step 8. In this case, steps 6 through 8 are equivalent to verifying an inclusion proof for the truncated subtree `[fn, sn + 1)` and truncated tree `tn + 1`.

# Test Vectors

## Accumulated Subtree Test Vectors

The following are "accumulated" {{Accumulated}} test vectors for the various subtree algorithms defined in {{subtrees}}.

They are hash values of the outputs of all possible inputs for each algorithm, for trees of sizes up to 130. They can be used to verify that an implementation matches the specification, without having to include a large number of individual test vectors.

For all the test vectors, a tree `D_n` of size `n` is constructed with leaf values `d[0] = 0x00, d[1] = 0x01, ...`. The hash function used is SHA-256. The hash values are encoded in hexadecimal.

### Subtree Hashes {#subtree-hash-vectors}

For each value of `end` from 0 to 130, and each value of `start` from 0 to `end`, if `[start, end)` is a valid subtree, add to the rolling hash the ASCII string `[START, END) HASH` followed by a newline (U+000A), where `START` and `END` are the decimal representations of `start` and `end`, respectively, and `HASH` is the hexadecimal encoding of `MTH(D[start:end])`, according to {{subtrees}}.

The final hash value is

~~~
b82806ad4265bb151c1119c0f4db437bb4d1a1f887b3a7fba1cd4ebf552e3e81
~~~

In Python, this can be expressed as:

~~~python
import hashlib
h = hashlib.sha256()
for end in range(0, 131):
    for start in range(end + 1):
        if valid_subtree(start, end):
            subtree_hash = MTH(D[start:end])
            h.update(f'[{start}, {end}) {subtree_hash.hex()}\n'.encode())
assert h.hexdigest() == 'b82806ad4265bb151c1119c0f4db437bb4d1a1f887b3a7fba1cd4ebf552e3e81'
~~~

This test exercises both an implementation's subtree hash calculation as well as the subtree validity check. In a CA, both of these operations apply. In a relying party, only the subtree validity check applies. A relying party implementation SHOULD implement a Merkle Tree in testing logic so the above will exercise the subtree validity check.

### Subtree Inclusion Proofs {#subtree-inclusion-proof-vectors}

For each value of `end` from 0 to 130, and each value of `start` from 0 to `end`, if `[start, end)` is a valid subtree, for each value of `index` from `start` to `end - 1`, add to the rolling hash the ASCII string `INDEX [START, END)`, then, for each hash in the inclusion proof ({{subtree-inclusion-proofs}}) for `d[index]` in the subtree `[start, end)`, a space (U+0020) followed by the hexadecimal encoding of that hash, and finally a newline (U+000A), where `INDEX` is the decimal representation of `index`, and `START` and `END` are the decimal representations of `start` and `end`, respectively.

The final hash value is

import hashlib

for end in range(0, 131):
    for start in range(end + 1):
        if valid_subtree(start, end):
            for index in range(start, end):
                inclusion_proof = get_inclusion_proof(D, start, end, index)
                line = f'{index} [{start}, {end})'
                for p in inclusion_proof:
                    line += f' {p.hex()}'
                h.update(f'{line}\n'.encode())
assert h.hexdigest() == 'ac2a8f989e44d99e399db448050ff5f19757df53cfb716aa81015d3955d8163f'
~~~

This test exercises constructing subtree inclusion proofs, as computed by a CA. A relying party instead evaluates untrusted subtree inclusion proofs. This test can be used to exercise this logic as follows:

1. If not available, implement a Merkle Tree in testing logic to compute subtree hashes and subtree inclusion proofs. This logic can be validated by the above test and {{subtree-hash-vectors}}.
2. For each subtree inclusion proof in the above test, evaluate the inclusion proof and assert the resulting hash matches the corresponding subtree hash.
3. For each non-empty subtree inclusion proof in the above test, truncate the proof by both one byte and a full hash. Assert that evaluating each proof fails.
4. For each subtree inclusion proof in the above test, extend the proof by both one byte and an arbitrary full hash. Assert that evaluating each proof fails.

### Subtree Consistency Proofs {#subtree-consistency-proof-vectors}

For each value of `n` from 0 to 130, and each value of `end` from 0 to `n`, and each value of `start` from 0 to `end`, if `[start, end)` is a valid subtree, add to the rolling hash the ASCII string `[START, END) N`, then, for each hash in the consistency proof ({{subtree-consistency-proofs}}) for the subtree `[start, end)` and tree of size `n`, a space (U+0020) followed by the hexadecimal encoding of that hash, and finally a newline (U+000A), where `START` and `END` are the decimal representations of `start` and `end`, respectively, and `N` is the decimal representation of `n`.

The final hash value is

                consistency_proof = get_consistency_proof(D, n, start, end)
                line = f'[{start}, {end}) {n}'
                for p in consistency_proof:
                    line += f' {p.hex()}'
                h.update(f'{line}\n'.encode())
assert h.hexdigest() == '10fa99b37bf9bf9ffa26b412fbd98bd75363256d0b75d61bc4538b9c9c5a0a74'
~~~

This test exercises constructing subtree consistency proofs. Other parties will check these proofs (e.g. {{trusted-subtrees}} and {{TLOG-WITNESS}}). This test can be used to exercise this logic as follows:

1. If not available, implement a Merkle Tree in testing logic to compute subtree hashes and subtree consistency proofs. This logic can be validated by the above test and {{subtree-hash-vectors}}.
2. For each subtree consistency proof in the above test, check the proof and assert it succeeds.
3. For each non-empty subtree consistency proof in the above test, truncate the proof by both one byte and a full hash. Assert that checking each proof fails.
4. For each subtree consistency proof in the above test, extend the proof by both one byte and an arbitrary full hash. Assert that checking each proof fails.
5. For each subtree consistency proof in the above test, flip a bit in the input subtree hash. Assert that checking each proof fails.
6. For each subtree consistency proof in the above test with a non-empty subtree, flip a bit in the input tree hash. Assert that checking each proof fails.

### Efficient Covering Subtrees

For each value of `end` from 0 to 130, and each value of `start` from 0 to `end`, add to the rolling hash the ASCII string `[LEFT_START, LEFT_END) [RIGHT_START, RIGHT_END)` followed by a newline (U+000A), where `LEFT_START`, `LEFT_END`, `RIGHT_START`, and `RIGHT_END` are the decimal representations of the start and end of the left and right subtrees, respectively, that efficiently cover ({{arbitrary-intervals}}) `[start, end)`.

~~~python
import hashlib

for end in range(0, 131):
    for start in range(end + 1):
        left_start, left_end, right_start, right_end = get_covering_subtrees(start, end)
        h.update(f'[{left_start}, {left_end}) [{right_start}, {right_end})\n'.encode())

## Large Subtree Test Vectors

{{accumulated-subtree-test-vectors}} exhaustively tests subtree algorithms for trees of size up to 130. An implementation may also encounter overflow conditions with very large trees. This is primarily a concern for a relying party, which must act on untrusted tree sizes.

The largest possible Merkle Tree in this protocol is 2<sup>48</sup>-1. In particular, the MTCProof structure in {{certificate-format}} cannot express larger values. These sizes will fit comfortably in 64-bit integers, whether signed or unsigned. To exercise more general implementations, this section includes test vectors for trees bounded by 2<sup>48</sup>-1, 2<sup>63</sup>-1, and 2<sup>64</sup>-1.

Implementations MAY skip tests above 2<sup>48</sup>-1 if they do not support such trees.

### Subtree Validity {#subtree-validity-large-vectors}

The following are valid subtrees ({{definition-of-a-subtree}}):

* start is 0 and end is 2<sup>47</sup> + 1
* start is 0 and end is 2<sup>48</sup> - 1
* start is 0 and end is 2<sup>62</sup> + 1
* start is 0 and end is 2<sup>63</sup> - 1
* start is 0 and end is 2<sup>63</sup> + 1
* start is 0 and end is 2<sup>64</sup> - 1

The following are not valid subtrees:

* start is 2<sup>46</sup> and end is 2<sup>47</sup> + 1
* start is 2<sup>46</sup> and end is 2<sup>48</sup> - 1
* start is 2<sup>61</sup> and end is 2<sup>62</sup> + 1
* start is 2<sup>61</sup> and end is 2<sup>63</sup> - 1
* start is 2<sup>62</sup> and end is 2<sup>63</sup> + 1
* start is 2<sup>62</sup> and end is 2<sup>64</sup> - 1

## End-to-End Certificate Test Vector

{{accumulated-subtree-test-vectors}} and {{large-subtree-test-vectors}} exercise the Merkle Tree algorithms with synthetic leaf values. This section provides a worked example of encoding a standalone Merkle Tree Certificate, including intermediate values from the TBSCertificate fields through the log entry, leaf hash, inclusion proof, cosignature, and resulting Certificate. Implementations can use it to debug the certificate construction and verification procedures in {{certificate-format}} and {{verifying-certificate-signatures}}.

The example uses draft version plants-05 with:

* CA ID `32473.1` and log number `1`
* A two-entry issuance log whose leaf 0 is a `tbs_cert_entry` and leaf 1 is a `null_entry`
* Subtree `[0, 2)` covering both entries
* A single Ed25519 cosignature from the CA cosigner (`32473.1`)

The leaf certificate uses ECDSA P-256, with `notBefore` 2020-01-01T00:00:00Z and `notAfter` 2020-12-31T23:59:59Z, subject common name `example.com`, and DNS names `example.com`, `a.example`, and `*.b.example`. The certificate serial is `0x1000000000000` (log number 1 in the high 16 bits and entry index 0 in the low 48 bits).

SHA-256 of the SubjectPublicKeyInfo is:

## Since draft-davidben-tls-merkle-tree-certs-04
{:numbered="false"}

Substantially reworked the design. The old design was essentially the landmark checkpoint and CA-built logs ideas, but targeting only the optimized and slow issuance path, and with a more bespoke tree structure:

In both draft-04 and draft-05, a CA looks like today's CAs except that they run some software to publish what they issue and sign tree heads to certify certificates in bulk.

In draft-04, the CA software publishes certificates in a bunch of independent Merkle Trees. This is very easy to do as a collection of highly cacheable, immutable static files because each tree is constructed independently, and never appended to after being built. In draft-05, the certificates are published in a single Merkle Tree. The {{TLOG-TILES}} interface allows such trees to also use highly cacheable, immutable static files.

In draft-04, there only are hourly tree heads. Clients are provisioned with tree heads ahead of time so we can make small, inclusion-proof-only certificates. In draft-05, the ecosystem must coordinate on defining "landmark" checkpoints. Clients are provisioned with subtrees describing landmark checkpoints ahead of time so we can make small, inclusion-proof-only certificates.

In draft-04, each tree head is independent. In draft-05, each landmark checkpoint contains all the previous checkpoints.

In draft-04, the independent tree heads were easily prunable. In draft-05, we define how to prune a Merkle Tree.

In draft-04, there is no fast issuance mode. In draft-05, frequent, non-landmark checkpoints can be combined with inclusion proofs and witness signatures for fast issuance. This is essentially an STH and inclusion proof in CT.
